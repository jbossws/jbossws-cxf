== Quick Start

JBossWS uses WildFly as its target container. The following examples
focus on web service deployments that leverage EJB3 service
implementations and the JAX-WS programming models. For further
information on POJO service implementations and advanced topics you need
consult the <<JAX-WS User Guide>>.

=== Developing web service implementations

JAX-WS does leverage annotations in order to express web service meta
data on Java components and to describe the mapping between Java data
types and XML. When developing web service implementations you need to
decide whether you are going to start with an abstract contract (WSDL)
or a Java component.

If you are in charge to provide the service implementation, then you are
probably going to start with the implementation and derive the abstract
contract from it. You are probably not even getting in touch with the
WSDL unless you hand it to 3rd party clients. For this reason we are
going to look at a service implementation that leverages
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/web-services-metadata/[Jakarta Web Service Metadata] .

[IMPORTANT]
====
Even though detailed knowledge of web service meta data is not required,
it will definitely help if you make yourself familiar with it. For
further information see

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/web-services-metadata/[Jakarta Web Service Metadata]

* http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=222[Java API for XML binding
(JAXB)]
* http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=224[Java API for XML-Based Web
Services]
====

==== The service implementation class

When starting from Java you must provide the service implementation. A
valid endpoint implementation class must meet the following
requirements:

* It _must_ carry a `javax.jws.WebService` annotation (see JSR 181)
* All method parameters and return types _must_ be compatible with the
JAXB 2.0

Let's look at a sample EJB3 component that is going to be exposed as a
web service.

Don't be confused with the EJB3 annotation `@Stateless` . We concentrate
on the `@WebService` annotation for now.

===== Implementing the service

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.retail.profile;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.jws.WebService;
import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding;

@Stateless                                                             (1)
@WebService(                                                           (2)
   name="ProfileMgmt",
   targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws/samples/retail/profile",
   serviceName = "ProfileMgmtService")
@SOAPBinding(parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE)         (3)
public class ProfileMgmtBean {

   @WebMethod                                                          (4)
   public DiscountResponse getCustomerDiscount(DiscountRequest request) {
      return new DiscountResponse(request.getCustomer(), 10.00);
   }
}
....

....
1. We are using a stateless session bean implementation
2. Exposed a web service with an explicit namespace
3. It's a doc/lit bare endpoint
4. And offers an 'getCustomerDiscount' operation
....

===== What about the payload?

The method parameters and return values are going to represent our XML
payload and thus require being compatible with JAXB2. Actually you
wouldn't need any JAXB annotations for this particular example, because
JAXB relies on meaningful defaults. For the sake of documentation we put
the more important ones here.

Take a look at the request parameter:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.retail.profile;

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType;

import org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.retail.Customer;

@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
@XmlType(                                                  (1)
  name = "discountRequest",
  namespace="http://org.jboss.ws/samples/retail/profile",
  propOrder = { "customer" }
)
public class DiscountRequest {

   protected Customer customer;

   public DiscountRequest() {
   }

   public DiscountRequest(Customer customer) {
      this.customer = customer;
   }

   public Customer getCustomer() {
      return customer;
   }

   public void setCustomer(Customer value) {
      this.customer = value;
   }

}
....

....
1. In this case we use @XmlType to specify an XML complex type name and override the namespace.
....

[NOTE]
====
If you have more complex mapping problems you need to consult the
http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxb/[JAXB documentation] .
====

==== Deploying service implementations

Service deployment basically depends on the implementation type. As you
may already know web services can be implemented as EJB3 components or
plain old Java objects. This quick start leverages EJB3 components,
that's why we are going to look at this case in the next sections.

===== EJB3 services

Simply wrap up the service implementation class, the endpoint interface
and any custom data types in a JAR and drop them in the _deployment_
directory. No additional deployment descriptors required. Any meta data
required for the deployment of the actual web service is taken from the
annotations provided on the implementation class and the service
endpoint interface. JBossWS will intercept that EJB3 deployment (the
bean will also be there) and create an HTTP endpoint at deploy-time.

===== The JAR package structure

jar -tf jaxws-samples-retail.jar

 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/DiscountRequest.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/DiscountResponse.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ObjectFactory.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ProfileMgmt.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ProfileMgmtBean.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ProfileMgmtService.class
 org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/package-info.class

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the deployment was successful you should be able to see your endpoint
in the application server management console.
====

=== Consuming web services

When creating web service clients you would usually start from the WSDL.
JBossWS ships with a set of tools to generate the required JAX-WS
artifacts to build client implementations. In the following section we
will look at the most basic usage patterns. For a more detailed
introduction to web service client please consult the user guide.

==== Creating the client artifacts

===== Using wsconsume

The _wsconsume_ tool is used to consume the abstract contract (WSDL) and
produce annotated Java classes (and optionally sources) that define it.
We are going to start with the WSDL from our retail example
(ProfileMgmtService.wsdl). For a detailed tool reference you need to
consult the user guide.

....
wsconsume is a command line tool that generates
portable JAX-WS artifacts from a WSDL file.

usage: org.jboss.ws.tools.jaxws.command.wsconsume [options] <wsdl-url>

options:
    -h, --help                  Show this help message
    -b, --binding=<file>        One or more JAX-WS or JAXB binding files
    -k, --keep                  Keep/Generate Java source
    -c  --catalog=<file>        Oasis XML Catalog file for entity resolution
    -p  --package=<name>        The target package for generated source
    -w  --wsdlLocation=<loc>    Value to use for @WebService.wsdlLocation
    -o, --output=<directory>    The directory to put generated artifacts
    -s, --source=<directory>    The directory to put Java source
    -q, --quiet                 Be somewhat more quiet
    -t, --show-traces           Show full exception stack traces
....

Let's try it on our sample:

....
~./wsconsume.sh -k -p org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.retail.profile ProfileMgmtService.wsdl  (1)

org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/Customer.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/DiscountRequest.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/DiscountResponse.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ObjectFactory.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ProfileMgmt.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/ProfileMgmtService.java
org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/retail/profile/package-info.java
....

[arabic]
. As you can see we did use the `-p` switch to specify the package name
of the generated sources.

===== The generated artifacts explained

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|File |Purpose
|ProfileMgmt.java |Service Endpoint Interface
|Customer.java |Custom data type
|Discount*.java |Custom data type
|ObjectFactory.java |JAXB XML Registry
|package-info.java |Holder for JAXB package annotations
|ProfileMgmtService.java |Service factory
|===

Basically _wsconsume_ generates all custom data types (JAXB annotated
classes), the service endpoint interface and a service factory class. We
will look at how these artifacts can be used the build web service
client implementations in the next section.

==== Constructing a service stub

Web service clients make use of a service stubs that hide the details of
a remote web service invocation. To a client application a WS invocation
just looks like an invocation of any other business component. In this
case the service endpoint interface acts as the business interface.
JAX-WS does use a service factory class to construct this as particular
service stub:

....
import javax.xml.ws.Service;
[...]
Service service = Service.create(                                 (1)
new URL("http://example.org/service?wsdl"),
new QName("MyService")
);
ProfileMgmt profileMgmt = service.getPort(ProfileMgmt.class);     (2)

// do something with the service stub here...                     (3)
....

[arabic]
. Create a service factory using the WSDL location and the service name
. Use the tool created service endpoint interface to build the service
stub
. Use the stub like any other business interface


==== Resolving dependencies and running the client

In order for successfully running a WS client application, a classloader
needs to be properly setup to include the JBossWS components and its
required transitive dependencies. Depending on the environment the
client is meant to be run in, this might imply adding some jars to the
classpath, or adding some artifact dependencies to the maven dependency
tree, etc. Moreover, even for simply developing a client, users might
need to resolve proper dependencies (e.g. to setup their IDE).

Below you find some options for resolving dependencies and running a WS
client using the JBossWS libraries:

===== Maven project

The JBossWS project is composed of multiple Maven artifacts that can be
used to declare dependencies in user Maven projects. In particular, the
`
              org.jboss.ws.cxf:jbossws-cxf-client
            ` artifact can be used for getting the whole JBossWS client
dependency. Users should simply add a dependency to it in their Maven
project.

If you're running the client out of the container, It's also recommended to
properly setup JAXWS implementation endorsing, to make sure you use the
JBossWS implementation of JAXWS API instead of relying on the
implementation coming with the JDK; this is usually done by copying the
`
              org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-factories
            ` (JBossWS-CXF stack) jar into a local directory (e.g.
_project.build.directory/endorsed_ ) and then using that for compiling
and running sources, for setting the _java.endorsed.dirs_ system
property into the maven-surefire-plugin, etc:

....
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 [http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd]">

....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Endorsing of JAX-WS *api* jar is used to force a API level different
from the one included in the JDK. E.g. JAXWS 2.2 on JDK 1.6, or JAXWS
2.1 on JDK 1.7, etc. So, depending on your environment, it might not be
strictly required.
====

[NOTE]
====
Endorsing is deprecated in JDK 1.8 and will be removed in future JDK
version. If you can't rely on endorsing with your JDK version, be sure
JBossWS components (in particular
`org.jboss.ws.cxf:jbossws-cxf-factories` ) come before jars of any other
JAX-WS implementation in your classpath.
====

===== JBoss Modules environment

An interesting approach for running a WS client is to leverage JBoss
Modules, basically getting a classloading environment equivalent to the
server container WS endpoints are run in. This is achieved by using the
_jboss-modules.jar_ coming with WildFly as follows:

....
java -jar $WILDFLY_HOME/jboss-modules.jar -mp $WILDFLY_HOME/modules -jar client.jar
....

The _client.jar_ is meant to contain the WS client application and
include a _MANIFEST.MF_ file specifying the proper `Main-Class` as well
as <<JBoss Modules>> dependencies, for instance:

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.jbws1666.TestClient
Dependencies: org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client
....

===== Flat classpath setup

Finally, users can of course setup their application classpath manually
(e.g when compiling and running the application directly through `javac`
/ `java` command or using `Ant` ). As for the Maven project approach
mentioned above, properly setting _java.endorsed.dirs_ system property
is also required.

=== Maven archetype quick start

A convenient approach to start a new project aiming at providing and/or
consuming a JAX-WS endpoint is to use the JBossWS _jaxws-codefirst_
Maven Archetype. A starting project (including working build and sample
helloworld client and endpoint) is created in few seconds. It's simply a
matter of issuing a command and answering to simple questions on the
desired artifact and group ids for the project being generated:

....
> mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.jboss.ws.plugins.archetypes:
....

The generated project includes:

* a sample HelloWorld code-first POJO endpoint
* an integration test that gets the WSDL contract for the above service,
builds up a client and invokes the endpoint
* a pom.xml for creating a war archive; the project has proper WS
component dependencies and uses both wsprovide and wsconsume maven
plugins for generating the contract for the code-first endpoint and then
generating the client stubs for such contract
* a plugin for deploying the archive on WildFly.

The project is built and tested by simply running:

....
> mvn wildfly:deploy
> mvn integration-test
....

The build processes the various plugins and calls into the JBossWS tools
to generate all the required classes for building the deployment archive
and client. The user can test the sample, have a look at the project
structure and then either trash the sample endpoint and testcase and
replace them with his own components, or modify them step-by-step to
achieve what he needs.
