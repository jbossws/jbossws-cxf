=== Logging

Logging of inbound and outbound messages is a common need. Different
approaches are available for achieving that:

==== JAX-WS Handler approach

A portable way of performing logging is writing a simple JAX-WS handler
dumping the messages that are passed to it; the handler can be added to
the desired client/endpoints (programmatically / using `@HandlerChain`
JAX-WS annotation).

The <<Predefined client and endpoint configurations>>
mechanism allows user to add the logging handler to any client/endpoint
or to some of them only (in which case the `@EndpointConfig` annotation
/ JBossWS API is required though).

==== Apache CXF approach

Apache CXF also comes with logging interceptors that can be easily used
to log messages to the console or configured client/server log files.
Those interceptors can be added to client, endpoint and buses in
multiple ways:

===== System property

Setting the `org.apache.cxf.logging.enabled` system property to true
causes the logging interceptors to be added to any `Bus` instance being
created on the JVM.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On WildFly, the system property is set by adding what follows to
the standalone / domain server configuration just after the extensions
section:

....
<system-properties>
  <property name="org.apache.cxf.logging.enabled" value="true"/>
</system-properties>
....
====

===== Manual interceptor addition and logging feature

Logging interceptors can be selectively added to endpoints using the
Apache CXF annotations `@org.apache.cxf.interceptor.InInterceptors` and
`@org.apache.cxf.interceptor.OutInterceptors` . The same is achieved on
the client side by programmatically adding new instances of the logging
interceptors to the client or the bus.

Apache CXF 3.2 has designated `@org.apache.cxf.feature.Features` the
preferred annotation for adding logging capabilities to clients and
endpoints. Annotation `@org.apache.cxf.annotations.Logging` and class
`org.apache.cxf.feature.LoggingFeature` have been deprecated.

Also in Apache CXF 3.2 classes
`LoggingInInterceptor, LoggingOutInterceptor,` and
`AbstractLoggingInterceptor` have been assigned a new package name. The
classes in package `org.apache.cxf.interceptor` have been deprecated.
These classes can now be found in package `org.apache.cxf.ext.logging`.

Please refer to the
http://cxf.apache.org/docs/debugging-and-logging.html#DebuggingandLogging-LoggingMessages[Apache
CXF documentation] for more details.

=== WS-* support

JBossWS includes most of the WS-* specification functionalities through
the integration with Apache CXF. In particular, the whole WS-Security
Policy framework is fully supported, enabling full contract driven
configuration of complex features like WS-Security.

More information can be found later in this chapter.

=== Address rewrite

JBossWS allows users to configure the _soap:address_ attribute in the
wsdl contract of deployed services.

==== Server configuration options

The configuration options are part of the
https://docs.wildfly.org/26/Admin_Guide.html#Web_services[webservices
subsystem section] of the WildFly domain model.

....
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:webservices:1.1">
  <wsdl-host>localhost</wsdl-host>
  <modify-wsdl-address>true</modify-wsdl-address>
<!--
  <wsdl-port>8080</wsdl-port>
  <wsdl-secure-port>8443</wsdl-secure-port>
-->
</subsystem>
....

If the content of _<soap:address>_ in the wsdl is a valid URL, JBossWS
will not rewrite it unless _modify-wsdl-address_ is true. If the content
of _<soap:address>_ is not a valid URL instead, JBossWS will always
rewrite it using the attribute values given below. Please note that the
variable _$\{jboss.bind.address}_ can be used to set the address which
the application is bound to at each startup.

The wsdl-secure-port and wsdl-port attributes are used to explicitly
define the ports to be used for rewriting the SOAP address. If these
attributes are not set, the ports will be identified by querying the
list of installed connectors. If multiple connectors are found the port
of the first connector is used.

==== Dynamic rewrite

When the application server is bound to multiple addresses or
non-trivial real-world network architectures cause request for different
external addresses to hit the same endpoint, a static rewrite of the
soap:address may not be enough. JBossWS allows for both the soap:address
in the wsdl and the wsdl address in the console to be rewritten with the
host use in the client request. This way, users always get the right
wsdl address assuming they're connecting to an instance having the
endpoint they're looking for. To trigger this behaviour, the
_jbossws.undefined.host_ value has to be specified for the _wsdl-host_
element.

....
<wsdl-host>jbossws.undefined.host</wsdl-host>
<modify-wsdl-address>true</modify-wsdl-address>
....

Of course, when a confidential transport address is required, the
addresses are always rewritten using https protocol and the port
currently configured for the https/ssl connector.

=== Configuration through deployment descriptor

The `jboss-webservices.xml` deployment descriptor can be used to provide
additional configuration for a given deployment. The expected location
of it is:

* `META-INF/jboss-webservices.xml` for EJB webservice deployments (JAR
archives)
* `WEB-INF/jboss-webservices.xml` for POJO webservice deployments and
EJB webservice endpoints bundled in `WAR` archives
* META-INF/jboss-webservices.xml for EAR archives containing webservices
deployment archives.

In case of jboss-webservices.xml descriptor included in both EAR and
included JAR/WAR archive, the contents of the descriptor included in the
JAR/WAR archives override the contents of the descriptor in the parent
EAR archive.

The structure of the file is the following (schemas are available
https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-spi/tree/main/src/main/resources/schema[here]
):

....
<webservices>
  <context-root/>?
  <config-name/>?
  <config-file/>?
  <property>*
    <name/>
    <value/>
  </property>
  <port-component>*
    <ejb-name/>
    <port-component-name/>
    <port-component-uri/>?
    <auth-method/>?
    <transport-guarantee/>?
    <secure-wsdl-access/>?
  </port-component>
  <webservice-description>*
    <webservice-description-name/>
    <wsdl-publish-location/>?
  </webservice-description>
</webservices>
....

==== context-root element

Element `<context-root>` can be used to customize context root of
webservices deployment.

....
<webservices>
  <context-root>foo</context-root>
</webservices>
....

==== config-name and config-file elements

Elements `<config-name>` and `<config-file>` can be used to associate
any endpoint provided in the deployment with a given
<<Predefined client and endpoint configurations>> . Endpoint configuration are
either specified in the referenced config file or in the WildFly domain
model (webservices subsystem). For further details on the endpoint
configurations and their management in the domain model, please see the
related
https://docs.wildfly.org/26/Admin_Guide.html#Web_services[documentation]
.

....
<webservices>
  <config-name>Standard WSSecurity Endpoint</config-name>
  <config-file>META-INF/custom.xml</config-file>
</webservices>
....

==== property element

`<property>` elements can be used to setup simple property values to
configure the ws stack behavior. Allowed property names and values are
mentioned in the guide under related topics.

....
<property>
  <name>prop.name</name>
  <value>prop.value</value>
</property>
....

==== component element

Element `<port-component>` can be used to customize EJB endpoint target
URI or to configure security related properties.

....
<webservices>
  <port-component>
    <ejb-name>TestService</ejb-name>
    <port-component-name>TestServicePort</port-component-name>
    <port-component-uri>/*</port-component-uri>
    <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
    <transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>
    <secure-wsdl-access>true</secure-wsdl-access>
  </port-component>
</webservices>
....

==== webservice-description element

Element `<webservice-description>` can be used to customize (override)
webservice WSDL publish location.

....
<webservices>
  <webservice-description>
    <webservice-description-name>TestService</webservice-description-name>
    <wsdl-publish-location>file:///bar/foo.wsdl</wsdl-publish-location>
  </webservice-description>
</webservices>
....

=== Schema validation of SOAP messages

Apache CXF has a feature for validating incoming and outgoing SOAP
messages on both client and server side. The validation is performed
against the relevant schema in the endpoint wsdl contract (server side)
or the wsdl contract used for building up the service proxy (client
side).

Schema validation can be turned on programmatically on client side

....
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put("schema-validation-enabled", true);
....

or using the `@org.apache.cxf.annotations.SchemaValidation` annotation
on server side

....
import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.apache.cxf.annotations.SchemaValidation;

@WebService(...)
@SchemaValidation
public class ValidatingHelloImpl implements Hello {
   ...
}
....

Alternatively, any endpoint and client running in-container can be
associated to a JBossWS <<Predefined client and endpoint configurations>>
having the `schema-validation-enabled` property set to `true` in the
referenced config file.

Finally, JBossWS also allows for server-wide (default) setup of schema
validation by using the _Standard-Endpoint-Config_ and
_Standard-Client-Config_ special configurations (which apply to any
client / endpoint unless a different configuration is specified for
them)

....
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:webservices:1.2">
    ...
    <endpoint-config name="Standard-Endpoint-Config">
        <property name="schema-validation-enabled" value="true"/>
    </endpoint-config>
    ...
    <client-config name="Standard-Client-Config">
        <property name="schema-validation-enabled" value="true"/>
    </client-config>
</subsystem>
....

=== JAXB Introductions
One common complaint from the JAXB users is the lack of support
for binding 3rd party classes. The scenario is this: you are trying to
annotate your classes with JAXB annotations to make it XML bindable, but
some classes are coming from libraries and JDK, and thus you
cannot put necessary JAXB annotations on it.

To solve this JAXB has been designed to provide hooks for programmatic
introduction of annotations to the runtime.

This is currently leveraged by the JBoss JAXB Introductions project,
in which users can define annotations in XML and make JAXB see those
as if those were in the class files (perhaps coming from 3rd party
libraries).

Look at the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-10075[JAXB
Introductions page] on the wiki and at the examples in the sources.

=== WSDL system properties expansion

See <<Published WSDL customization>>.

=== Predefined client and endpoint configurations

==== Overview

JBossWS permits extra setup configuration data to be predefined and
associated with an endpoint or a client. Configurations can include
JAX-WS handlers and key/value property declarations that control JBossWS
and Apache CXF internals. Predefined configurations can be used for
JAX-WS client and JAX-WS endpoint setup.

Configurations can be defined in the webservice subsystem and in an
application's deployment descriptor file. There can be many
configuration definitions in the webservice subsystem and in an
application. Each configuration must have a name that is unique within
the server. Configurations defined in an application are local to the
application. Endpoint implementations declare the use of a specific
configuration through the use of the
`org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.EndpointConfig` annotation. An endpoint
configuration defined in the webservices subsystem is available to all
deployed applications on the server container and can be referenced by
name in the annotation. An endpoint configuration defined in an
application must be referenced by both deployment descriptor file name
and configuration name by the annotation.

*Handlers*

Each endpoint configuration may be associated with zero or more PRE and
POST handler chains. Each handler chain may include JAX-WS handlers. For
outbound messages the PRE handler chains are executed before any handler
that is attached to the endpoint using the standard means, such as with
annotation @HandlerChain, and POST handler chains are executed after
those objects have executed. For inbound messages the POST handler
chains are executed before any handler that is attached to the endpoint
using the standard means and the PRE handler chains are executed after
those objects have executed.

....
* Server inbound messages
Client --> ... --> POST HANDLER --> ENDPOINT HANDLERS --> PRE HANDLERS --> Endpoint

* Server outbound messages
Endpoint --> PRE HANDLER --> ENDPOINT HANDLERS --> POST HANDLERS --> ... --> Client
....

The same applies for client configurations.

*Properties*

Key/value properties are used for controlling both some Apache CXF
internals and some JBossWS options. Specific supported values are
mentioned where relevant in the rest of the documentation.

==== Assigning configurations

Endpoints and clients are assigned configuration through different
means. Users can explicitly require a given configuration or rely on
container defaults. The assignment process can be split up as follows:

* Explicit assignment through annotations (for endpoints) or API
programmatic usage (for clients)
* Automatic assignment of configurations from default descriptors
* Automatic assignment of configurations from container

===== Explicit configuration assignment

The explicit configuration assignment is meant for developer that know
in advance their endpoint or client has to be setup according to a
specified configuration. The configuration is either coming from a
descriptor that is included in the application deployment, or is
included in the application server webservices subsystem management
model.

====== Configuration Deployment Descriptor

Jakarta EE archives that can contain JAX-WS client and endpoint
implementations can also contain predefined client and endpoint
configuration declarations. All endpoint/client configuration
definitions for a given archive must be provided in a single deployment
descriptor file, which must be an implementation of schema
https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-spi/blob/main/src/main/resources/schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd[jbossws-jaxws-config]
. Many endpoint/client configurations can be defined in the deployment
descriptor file. Each configuration must have a name that is unique
within the server on which the application is deployed. The
configuration name can't be referred to by endpoint/client
implementations outside the application. Here is an example of a
descriptor, containing two endpoint configurations:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:jakartaee="xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">
  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.jbws3282.Endpoint4Impl</config-name>
    <pre-handler-chains>
      <jakartaee:handler-chain>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Log Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.jbws3282.LogHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
      </jakartaee:handler-chain>
    </pre-handler-chains>
    <post-handler-chains>
      <jakartaee:handler-chain>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Routing Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.jbws3282.RoutingHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
      </jakartaee:handler-chain>
    </post-handler-chains>
  </endpoint-config>
  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>EP6-config</config-name>
    <post-handler-chains>
      <jakartaee:handler-chain>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Authorization Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.jbws3282.AuthorizationHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
      </jakartaee:handler-chain>
    </post-handler-chains>
  </endpoint-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

Similarly, client configurations can be specified in descriptors (still
implementing the schema mentioned above):

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">
  <client-config>
    <config-name>Custom Client Config</config-name>
    <pre-handler-chains>
      <jakartaee:handler-chain>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Routing Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.clientConfig.RoutingHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Custom Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.clientConfig.CustomHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
      </jakartaee:handler-chain>
    </pre-handler-chains>
  </client-config>
  <client-config>
    <config-name>Another Client Config</config-name>
    <post-handler-chains>
      <jakartaee:handler-chain>
        <jakartaee:handler>
          <jakartaee:handler-name>Routing Handler</jakartaee:handler-name>
          <jakartaee:handler-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.clientConfig.RoutingHandler</jakartaee:handler-class>
        </jakartaee:handler>
      </jakartaee:handler-chain>
    </post-handler-chains>
  </client-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

====== Application server configurations

WildFly allows declaring JBossWS client and server predefined
configurations in the _webservices_ subsystem section of the server
model. As a consequence it is possible to declare server-wide handlers
to be added to the chain of each endpoint or client assigned to a given
configuration.

Please refer to the
https://docs.wildfly.org/26/Admin_Guide.html#Web_services[WildFly
documentation] for details on managing the _webservices_ subsystem such
as adding, removing and modifying handlers and properties.

The allowed contents in the _webservices_ subsystem are defined by the
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/main/webservices/server-integration/src/main/resources/schema/jboss-as-webservices_2_0.xsd[schema]
included in the application server.

* Standard configurations

Clients running in-container as well as endpoints are assigned standard
configurations by default. The defaults are used unless different
configurations are set as described on this page. This enables
administrators to tune the default handler chains for client and
endpoint configurations. The names of the default client and endpoint
configurations, used in the webservices subsystem are
`Standard-Client-Config` and `Standard-Endpoint-Config` respectively.

* Handlers classloading

When setting a server-wide handler, please note the handler class needs
to be available through each ws deployment classloader. As a consequence
proper module dependencies might need to be specified in the deployments
that are going to leverage a given predefined configuration. A shortcut
is to add a dependency to the module containing the handler class in one
of the modules which are already automatically set as dependencies to
any deployment, for instance `org.jboss.ws.spi` .

* Examples

....
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:webservices:2.0">
    <!-- ... -->
    <endpoint-config name="Standard-Endpoint-Config"/>
    <endpoint-config name="Recording-Endpoint-Config">
        <pre-handler-chain name="recording-handlers" protocol-bindings="##SOAP11_HTTP ##SOAP11_HTTP_MTOM ##SOAP12_HTTP ##SOAP12_HTTP_MTOM">

    <client-config name="Standard-Client-Config">
        <property name="schema-validation-enabled" value="true"/>
    </client-config>
</subsystem>
....

====== EndpointConfig annotation

Once a configuration is available to a given application, the
`org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.EndpointConfig` annotation is used to
assign an endpoint configuration to a JAX-WS endpoint implementation.
When assigning a configuration that is defined in the webservices
subsystem only the configuration name is specified. When assigning a
configuration that is defined in the application, the relative path to
the deployment descriptor and the configuration name must be specified.

....
@EndpointConfig(configFile = "WEB-INF/my-endpoint-config.xml", configName = "Custom WS-Security Endpoint")
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Secure Hello World!";
   }
}
....

====== JAXWS Feature

The most practical way of setting a configuration is using
`org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigFeature` , a JAX-WS `Feature`
extension provided by JBossWS:

....
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigFeature;

...

Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
Endpoint port = service.getPort(Endpoint.class, new ClientConfigFeature("META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config"));
port.echo("Kermit");

... or ....

port = service.getPort(Endpoint.class, new ClientConfigFeature("META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config"), true); //setup properties too from the configuration
port.echo("Kermit");
... or ...

port = service.getPort(Endpoint.class, new ClientConfigFeature(null, testConfigName)); //reads from current container configurations if available
port.echo("Kermit");
....

JBossWS parses the specified configuration file. The configuration file
must be found as a resource by the classloader of the current thread.
The
https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-spi/tree/main/src/main/resources/schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd[jbossws-jaxws-config
schema] defines the descriptor contents and is included in the
_jbossws-spi_ artifact.

====== Explicit setup through API

Alternatively, JBossWS API comes with facility classes that can be used
for assigning configurations when building a client. JAX-WS handlers read
from client configurations as follows:

....
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigUtil;
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigurer;

...

Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
Endpoint port = service.getPort(Endpoint.class);
BindingProvider bp = (BindingProvider)port;
ClientConfigUtil.setConfigHandlers(bp, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 1");
port.echo("Kermit");

...

ClientConfigurer configurer = ClientConfigUtil.resolveClientConfigurer();
configurer.setConfigHandlers(bp, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 2");
port.echo("Kermit");

...

configurer.setConfigHandlers(bp, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 3");
port.echo("Kermit");


...

configurer.setConfigHandlers(bp, null, "Container Custom Client Config"); //reads from current container configurations if available
port.echo("Kermit");
....

... similarly, properties are read from client configurations as
follows:

....
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigUtil;
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigurer;

...

Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
Endpoint port = service.getPort(Endpoint.class);

ClientConfigUtil.setConfigProperties(port, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 1");
port.echo("Kermit");

...

ClientConfigurer configurer = ClientConfigUtil.resolveClientConfigurer();
configurer.setConfigProperties(port, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 2");
port.echo("Kermit");

...

configurer.setConfigProperties(port, "META-INF/my-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config 3");
port.echo("Kermit");


...

configurer.setConfigProperties(port, null, "Container Custom Client Config"); //reads from current container configurations if available
port.echo("Kermit");
....

The default `ClientConfigurer` implementation parses the specified
configuration file, if any, after having resolved it as a resources
using the current thread context classloader. The
https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-spi/tree/main/src/main/resources/schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd[jbossws-jaxws-config
schema] defines the descriptor contents and is included in the
_jbossws-spi_ artifact.

===== Automatic configuration from default descriptors

In some cases, the application developer might not be aware of the
configuration that will need to be used for its client and endpoint
implementation, perhaps because that's a concern of the application
deployer. In other cases, explicit usage (compile time dependency) of
JBossWS API might not be accepted. To cope with such scenarios, JBossWS
allows including default client ( `jaxws-client-config.xml` ) and
endpoint ( `jaxws-endpoint-config.xml` ) descriptor within the
application (in its root), which are parsed for getting configurations
any time a configuration file name is not specified.

If the configuration name is also not specified, JBossWS automatically
looks for a configuration named the same as

* the endpoint implementation class (full qualified name), in case of
JAX-WS endpoints;
* the service endpoint interface (full qualified name), in case of
JAX-WS clients.

No automatic configuration name is selected for `Dispatch` clients.

So, for instance, an endpoint implementation class
`org.foo.bar.EndpointImpl` for which no pre-defined configuration is
explicitly set will cause JBossWS to look for a
_org.foo.bar.EndpointImpl_ named configuration within a
_jaxws-endpoint-config.xml_ descriptor in the root of the application
deployment. Similarly, on the client side, a client proxy implementing
`org.foo.bar.Endpoint` interface (SEI) will have the setup read from a
_org.foo.bar.Endpoint_ named configuration in _jaxws-client-config.xml_
descriptor.

===== Automatic configuration assignment from container setup

JBossWS fall-backs to getting predefined configurations from the
container setup whenever no explicit configuration has been provided and
the default descriptors are either not available or do not contain
relevant configurations. This gives additional control on the JAX-WS
client and endpoint setup to administrators, as the container setup can
be managed independently of the deployed applications.

JBossWS hence accesses the webservices subsystem the same as explained
above for explicitly named configuration; the default configuration
names used for look are

* the endpoint implementation class (full qualified name), in case of
JAX-WS endpoints;
* the service endpoint interface (full qualified name), in case of
JAX-WS clients.

`Dispatch` clients are not automatically configured. If no configuration
is found using names computed as above, the `Standard-Client-Config` and
`Standard-Endpoint-Config` configurations are used for clients and
endpoints respectively


=== Authentication

==== Authentication

Here the simplest way to authenticate a web service user with JBossWS is
explained.

First we secure the access to the SLSB as we would do for normal (non
web service) invocations: this can be easily done through the
@RolesAllowed, @PermitAll, @DenyAll annotation. The allowed user roles
can be set with these annotations both on the bean class and on any of
its business methods.

....
@Stateless
@RolesAllowed("friend")
public class EndpointEJB implements EndpointInterface
{
  ...
}
....

Similarly POJO endpoints are secured the same way as we do for normal
web applications in web.xml:

....
<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>All resources</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </web-resource-collection>
  <auth-constraint>
    <role-name>friend</role-name>
  </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

<security-role>
  <role-name>friend</role-name>
</security-role>
....

===== Specify the security domain

Next, specify the security domain for this deployment. This is performed
using the `@SecurityDomain` annotation for EJB3 endpoints

....
@Stateless
@SecurityDomain("JBossWS")
@RolesAllowed("friend")
public class EndpointEJB implements EndpointInterface
{
  ...
}
....

or modifying the jboss-web.xml for POJO endpoints

....
<jboss-web>
<security-domain>JBossWS</security-domain>
</jboss-web>
....

The security domain is the authentication and authorization
mechanism. Security domains are defined differently depending on the server in use.

===== Use BindingProvider to set principal/credential

A web service client may use the `jakarta.xml.ws.BindingProvider`
interface to set the username/password combination

....
URL wsdlURL = new File("resources/jaxws/samples/context/WEB-INF/wsdl/TestEndpoint.wsdl").toURL();
QName qname = new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/context", "TestEndpointService");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, qname);
port = (TestEndpoint)service.getPort(TestEndpoint.class);

BindingProvider bp = (BindingProvider)port;
bp.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "kermit");
bp.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "thefrog");
....

===== Using HTTP Basic Auth for security

To enable HTTP Basic authentication use the `@WebContext` annotation
on the bean class

....
@Stateless
@SecurityDomain("JBossWS")
@RolesAllowed("friend")
@WebContext(contextRoot="/my-cxt", urlPattern="/*", authMethod="BASIC", transportGuarantee="NONE", secureWSDLAccess=false)
public class EndpointEJB implements EndpointInterface
{
  ...
}
....

For POJO endpoints, we modify the _web.xml_ adding the auth-method
element:

....
<login-config>
  <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
  <realm-name>Test Realm</realm-name>
</login-config>
....

=== Apache CXF integration

==== JBossWS integration layer with Apache CXF

All JAX-WS functionalities provided by JBossWS on top of WildFly are
currently served through a proper integration of the JBoss Web Services
stack with most of the https://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] project
modules.

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. It allows building and
developing services using frontend programming APIs (including JAX-WS),
with services speaking a variety of protocols such as SOAP and XML/HTTP
over a variety of transports such as HTTP and JMS.

The integration layer ( _JBossWS-CXF_ in short hereafter) is mainly
meant for:

* allowing using standard webservices APIs (including JAX-WS) on
WildFly; this is performed internally leveraging Apache CXF without
requiring the user to deal with it;
* allowing using Apache CXF advanced features (including WS-*) on top of
WildFly without requiring the user to deal with / setup / care about the
required integration steps for running in such a container.

In order for achieving the goals above, the JBossWS-CXF integration
supports the JBoss ws endpoint deployment mechanism and comes with many
internal customizations on top of Apache CXF.

In the next sections a list of technical suggestions and notes on the
integration is provided; please also refer to the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/index.html[Apache CXF official documentation]
for in-depth details on the CXF architecture.

==== Building WS applications the JBoss way

The Apache CXF client and endpoint configuration as explained in the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/index.html[Apache CXF official user guide] is
heavily based on Spring. Apache CXF basically parses Spring `cxf.xml`
descriptors; those may contain any basic bean plus specific ws client
and endpoint beans which CXF has custom parsers for. Apache CXF can be
used to deploy webservice endpoints on any servlet container by
including its libraries in the deployment; in such a scenario Spring
basically serves as a convenient configuration option, given direct
Apache CXF API usage won't be very handy. Similar reasoning applies on
client side, where a Spring based descriptor offers to a shortcut for
setting up Apache CXF internals.

This said, nowadays almost any Apache CXF functionality can be
configured and used through direct API usage, without Spring. As a
consequence and given the considerations in the sections below,
the JBossWS integration with Apache CXF does not rely on Spring
descriptors.

===== Portable applications

WildFly is much more then a servlet container; it actually provides
users with a fully compliant target platform for Java EE applications.

Generally speaking, _users are encouraged to write portable
applications_ by relying only on _JAX-WS specification_ whenever
possible, that would by the way ensure easy migrations to and from other
compliant platforms. Being a Java EE container, WildFly already comes
with a JAX-WS compliant implementation, which is basically Apache CXF
plus the JBossWS-CXF integration layer. So users just need to write
their JAX-WS application; _no need for embedding any Apache CXF or any
ws related dependency library in user deployments_ . Please refer to the
<<Advanced User Guide>>  of the documentation for getting started.

WS-* usage (including WS-Security, WS-Addressing, WS-ReliableMessaging,
...) should also be configured in the most portable way; that is by
_relying on proper WS-Policy assertions_ on the endpoint WSDL contracts,
so that client and endpoint configuration is basically a matter of
setting few ws context properties. The WS-* related sections of this
documentation cover all the details on configuring applications making
use of WS-* through policies.

As a consequence of the reasoning above, the JBossWS-CXF integration is
currently built directly on the Apache CXF API and aims at allowing
users to configure webservice clients and endpoints _without Spring
descriptors_ .

===== Direct Apache CXF API usage

Whenever users can't meet their application requirements with
JAX-WS plus WS-Policy, it is still possible to rely on direct
Apache CXF API usage (given that's included in the AS).  The
transition to Jakarta EE could affect portability of newer applications
to legacy systems, that could be the case of a user
needing specific Apache CXF functionalities, or having to consume WS-*
enabled endpoints advertised through legacy wsdl contracts without
WS-Policy assertions.

On server side, direct Apache CXF API usage might not always be possible
or end up being not very easy. For this reason, the JBossWS integration
comes with a convenient alternative through customization options in the
`jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor described below on this page.
Properties can be declared in `jboss-webservices.xml` to control Apache
CXF internals like _interceptors_ , _features_ , etc.

==== Bus usage

===== Creating a Bus instance

Most of the Apache CXF features are configurable using the
`org.apache.cxf.Bus` class. While for basic JAX-WS usage the user might
never need to explicitly deal with Bus, using Apache CXF specific
features generally requires getting a handle to a `org.apache.cxf.Bus`
instance. This can happen on client side as well as in a ws endpoint or
handler business code.

New Bus instances are produced by the currently configured
`org.apache.cxf.BusFactory` implementation the following way:

....
Bus bus = BusFactory.newInstance().createBus();
....

The algorithm for selecting the actual implementation of `BusFactory` to
be used leverages the Service API, looking for optional
configurations in _META-INF/services/..._ location using the current
thread context classloader. JBossWS-CXF integration comes with its own
implementation of `BusFactory` ,
`org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.client.configuration.JBossWSBusFactory` , that
allows for seamless setup of JBossWS customizations on top of Apache
CXF. Assuming the JBossWS-CXF libraries are available in the current
thread context classloader, the `JBossWSBusFactory` is _automatically_
retrieved by the `BusFactory.newInstance()` call above.

JBossWS users willing to explicitly use functionalities of
`org.apache.cxf.bus.CXFBusFactory` _,_ get the same API with JBossWS
additions through `JBossWSBusFactory` :

....
Map<Class, Object> myExtensions = new HashMap<Class, Object>();
myExtensions.put(...);
Bus bus = new JBossWSBusFactory().createBus(myExtensions);
....

===== Using existing Bus instances

Apache CXF keeps reference to a global default `Bus` instance as well as
to a thread default bus for each thread.  That is performed through
static members in `org.apache.cxf.BusFactory` _,_ which also comes with
the following methods in the public API:

....
public static synchronized Bus getDefaultBus()
public static synchronized Bus getDefaultBus(boolean createIfNeeded)
public static synchronized void setDefaultBus(Bus bus)
public static Bus getThreadDefaultBus()
public static Bus getThreadDefaultBus(boolean createIfNeeded)
public static void setThreadDefaultBus(Bus bus)
....

Please note that the default behaviour of `getDefaultBus()` _/_
`getDefaultBus(true)` _/_ `getThreadDefaultBus()` _/_
`getThreadDefaultBus(true)` is to create a new Bus instance if that's
not set yet. Moreover _getThreadDefaultBus()_ and
_getThreadDefaultBus(true)_ first fallback to retrieving the configured
global default bus before trying to create a new instance (and
the created new instance is set as global default bus if it is not yet
set).

The drawback of this mechanism (which is fine in JSE
environment) is that when running in the WildFly container you need to be
careful in order not to (mis)use a bus over multiple applications
(assuming the Apache CXF classes are loaded by the same classloader,
which is currently the case with WildFly).

Here is a list of general suggestions to avoid problems when running
in-container:

* forget about the global default bus; you don't need that, so don't do
`getDefaultBus()` _/_ `getDefaultBus(true)` _/_ `setDefaultBus()` in
your code;
* avoid `getThreadDefaultBus()` _/_ `getThreadDefaultBus(true)` unless
you already know for sure the default bus is already set;
* keep in mind thread pooling whenever customizing a thread default
bus instance (for instance adding bus scope interceptors, ...), as that
thread and bus might be later reused; either shutdown the bus when
you're done or explicitly remove it from the BusFactory thread
association.

Finally, remember that each time you explictly create a new Bus instance
(factory.createBus()) that is set as thread default bus and global
default bus if those are not set yet.

The JAX-WS `Provider` implementation also creates `Bus` instances
internally, in particular the JBossWS version of JAX-WS `Provider` makes
sure the default bus is never internally used and instead a new `Bus` is
created if required (more details on this in the next paragraph).

===== Bus selection strategies for JAXWS clients

JAX-WS clients require an Apache CXF Bus to be available; the client is
registered within the Bus and the Bus affects the client behavior (e.g.
through the configured CXF interceptors). The way a bus is internally
selected for serving a given JAX-WS client is very important, especially
for in-container clients; for this reason, JBossWS users can choose the
preferred Bus selection strategy. The strategy is enforced in the
`jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider` implementation from the JBossWS integration,
being that called whenever a JAX-WS `Service` (client) is requested.

====== Thread bus strategy (THREAD_BUS)

Each time the vanilla JAX-WS api is used to create a Bus, the JBossWS-CXF
integration will automatically make sure a Bus is currently associated
to the current thread in the BusFactory. If that's not the case, a new
Bus is created and linked to the current thread (to prevent the user
from relying on the default Bus). The Apache CXF engine will then create
the client using the current thread Bus.

This is the default strategy, and the most straightforward one in Java
SE environments; it lets users automatically reuse a previously created
Bus instance and allows using customized Bus that can possibly be
created and associated to the thread before building up a JAX-WS client.

The drawback of the strategy is that the link between the Bus instance
and the thread needs to be eventually cleaned up (when not needed
anymore). This is really evident in a Jakarta EE environment (hence when
running in-container), as threads from pools (e.g. serving web requests)
are re-used.

When relying on this strategy, the safest approach to be sure of
cleaning up the link is to surround the JAX-WS client with a
`try/finally` block as below:

....
try {
  Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceQName);
  MyEndpoint port = service.getPort(MyEndpoint.class);
  //...
} finally {
  BusFactory.setThreadDefaultBus(null);
  // OR (if you don't need the bus and the client anymore)
  Bus bus = BusFactory.getThreadDefaultBus(false);
  bus.shutdown(true);
}
....

====== New bus strategy (NEW_BUS)

Another strategy is to have the JAX-WS Provider from the JBossWS
integration create a new Bus each time a JAX-WS client is built. The main
benefit of this approach is that a fresh bus won't rely on any formerly
cached information (e.g. cached WSDL / schemas) which might have changed
after the previous client creation. The main drawback is of course worse
performance as the Bus creation takes time.

If there's a bus already associated with the current thread before the
JAX-WS client creation, that is automatically restored when returning
control to the user; in other words, the newly created bus will be used
only for the created JAX-WS client but won't stay associated with the
current thread at the end of the process. Similarly, if the thread was
not associated with any bus before the client creation, no bus will be
associated with the thread at the end of the client creation.

====== Thread context classloader bus strategy (TCCL_BUS)

The last strategy is to have the bus created for serving the client be
associated with the current thread context classloader (TCCL). That
basically means, the same Bus instance is shared by JAX-WS clients running
when the same TCCL is set. This is particularly interesting as each web
application deployment usually has its own context classloader. This
strategy is possibly a way to keep the number of created Bus instances
bound to the application number in a WildFly container.

If there's a bus already associated with the current thread before the
JAX-WS client creation, that is automatically restored when returning
control to the user; in other words, the bus corresponding to the
current thread context classloader will be used only for the created
JAX-WS client but won't stay associated with the current thread at the end
of the process. If the thread was not associated with any bus before the
client creation, a new bus will be created (and later user for any other
client built with this strategy and the same TCCL in place); no bus will
be associated with the thread at the end of the client creation.

====== Strategy configuration

Users can request a given Bus selection strategy to be used for the
client being built by specifying one of the following JBossWS features
(which extend `jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature` ):

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Feature |Strategy
|`org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.client.UseThreadBusFeature` |THREAD_BUS

|`org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.client.UseNewBusFeature` |NEW_BUS

|`org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.client.UseTCCLBusFeature` |TCCL_BUS
|===

The feature is specified as follows:

....
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceQName, new UseThreadBusFeature());
....

If no feature is explicitly specified, the system default strategy is
used, which can be modified through the
`org.jboss.ws.cxf.jaxws-client.bus.strategy` system property when
starting the JVM. The valid values for the property are `THREAD_BUS` ,
`NEW_BUS` and `TCCL_BUS` . The default is `THREAD_BUS` .

==== Server Side Integration Customization

The JBossWS-CXF server side integration takes care of internally
creating proper Apache CXF structures (including a `Bus` instance, of
course) for the provided ws deployment. Should the deployment include
multiple endpoints, those would all live within the same Apache CXF Bus,
which would be completely separated by the other deployments'
bus instances.

While JBossWS sets sensible defaults for most of the Apache CXF
configuration options on server side, users might want to fine tune the
`Bus` instance that's created for their deployment; a
`jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor can be used for deployment level
customizations.

===== Deployment descriptor properties

The `jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor can be used to
provide property values for <<component element>>

....
<webservices xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="1.2">
  ...
  <property>
    <name>...</name>
    <value>...</value>
  </property>
  ...
</webservices>
....

JBossWS-CXF integration comes with a set of allowed property names to
control Apache CXF internals.

====== WorkQueue configuration

Apache CXF uses WorkQueue instances for dealing with some operations
(e.g. @Oneway requests processing). A
https://cxf.apache.org/javadoc/latest/org/apache/cxf/workqueue/WorkQueueManager.html[WorkQueueManager]
is installed in the Bus as an extension and allows for adding / removing
queues as well as controlling the existing ones.

On server side, queues can be provided by using the
`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.*` properties in `jboss-webservices.xml` (e.g.
`cxf.queue.default.maxQueueSize` for controlling the max queue size of
the `default` workqueue). At deployment time, the JBossWS integration
can add new instances of
https://cxf.apache.org/javadoc/latest/org/apache/cxf/workqueue/AutomaticWorkQueueImpl.html[AutomaticWorkQueueImpl]
to the currently configured WorkQueueManager; the properties below are
used to fill in parameter into the
https://cxf.apache.org/javadoc/latest/org/apache/cxf/workqueue/AutomaticWorkQueueImpl.html#AutomaticWorkQueueImpl(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20long,%20java.lang.String)[AutomaticWorkQueueImpl
constructor] :

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Default value
|`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.maxQueueSize` |256
|`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.initialThreads` |0
|`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.highWaterMark` |25
|`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.lowWaterMark` |5
|`cxf.queue.<queue-name>.dequeueTimeout` |120000
|===

====== Policy alternative selector

The Apache CXF policy engine supports different strategies to deal with
policy alternatives. JBossWS-CXF integration currently defaults to the
https://cxf.apache.org/javadoc/latest/org/apache/cxf/ws/policy/selector/MaximalAlternativeSelector.html[MaximalAlternativeSelector]
, but still allows for setting different selector implementation using
the `cxf.policy.alternativeSelector` property in `jboss-webservices.xml`
.

====== MBean management

Apache CXF allows managing its MBean objects that are installed into the
WildFly MBean server. The feature is enabled on a deployment basis
through the `cxf.management.enabled` property in `jboss-webservices.xml`
. The `cxf.management.installResponseTimeInterceptors` property can also
be used to control installation of CXF response time interceptors, which
are added by default when enabling MBean management, but might not be
desired in some cases. Here is an example:

....
<webservices xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="1.2">
  <property>
    <name>cxf.management.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>cxf.management.installResponseTimeInterceptors</name>
    <value>false</value>
  </property>
</webservices>
....

====== Schema validation

Schema validation of exchanged messages can also be enabled in
`jboss-webservices.xml` . Further details available
<<Configuration through deployment descriptor>>

====== Interceptors

The `jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor also allows specifying the
`cxf.interceptors.in` and `cxf.interceptors.out` properties; those
allows declaring interceptors to be attached to the Bus instance that's
created for serving the deployment.

....
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<webservices
  xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  version="1.3"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee">

  <property>
    <name>cxf.interceptors.in</name>
    <value>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.BusInterceptor</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>cxf.interceptors.out</name>
    <value>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.BusCounterInterceptor</value>
  </property>
</webservices>
....

====== Features

The `jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor also allows specifying the
`cxf.features` property; that allows declaring features to be attached
to any endpoint belonging to the Bus instance that's created for serving
the deployment.

....
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<webservices
  xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  version="1.3"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee">

  <property>
    <name>cxf.features</name>
    <value>org.apache.cxf.feature.FastInfosetFeature</value>
  </property>
</webservices>
....

====== Discovery enablement

WS-Discovery support can be turned on in `jboss-webservices` for the
current deployment. Further details available <<Configuration through deployment descriptor>> .

==== Apache CXF interceptors

Apache CXF supports declaring interceptors using one of the following
approaches:

* Annotation usage on endpoint classes (
`@org.apache.cxf.interceptor.InInterceptor` ,
`@org.apache.cxf.interceptor.OutInterceptor` )
* Direct API usage on client side (through the
`org.apache.cxf.interceptor.InterceptorProvider` interface)
* Spring descriptor usage ( _cxf.xml_ )

As the Spring descriptor usage is not supported, the JBossWS integration
adds an additional descriptor based approach to avoid requiring
modifications to the actual client/endpoint code. Users can declare
interceptors within <<Predefined client and endpoint configurations>> by specifying a list of interceptor class names for the
`cxf.interceptors.in` and `cxf.interceptors.out` properties.

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">
  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.EndpointImpl</config-name>
    <property>
      <property-name>cxf.interceptors.in</property-name>
      <property-value>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.EndpointInterceptor,org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.FooInterceptor</property-value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <property-name>cxf.interceptors.out</property-name>
      <property-value>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.interceptors.EndpointCounterInterceptor</property-value>
    </property>
  </endpoint-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

A new instance of each specified interceptor class will be added to the
client or endpoint the configuration is assigned to. The interceptor
classes must have a no-argument constructor.


==== Apache CXF features

Apache CXF supports declaring features using one of the following
approaches:

* Annotation usage on endpoint classes (
`@org.apache.cxf.feature.Features` )
* Direct API usage on client side (through extensions of the
`org.apache.cxf.feature.AbstractFeature` class)
* Spring descriptor usage ( _cxf.xml_ )

As the Spring descriptor usage is not supported, the JBossWS integration
adds a descriptor based approach to avoid requiring
modifications to the actual client/endpoint code. Users can declare
features by specifying a list of feature class names for the
`cxf.features` property.

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">
  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>Custom FI Config</config-name>
    <property>
      <property-name>cxf.features</property-name>
      <property-value>org.apache.cxf.feature.FastInfosetFeature</property-value>
    </property>
  </endpoint-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

A new instance of each specified feature class will be added to the
client or endpoint the configuration is assigned to. The feature classes
must have a no-argument constructor.

==== Properties driven bean creation

Sections above explain how to declare CXF interceptors and features
through properties either in a client/endpoint predefined configuration
or in a `jboss-webservices.xml` descriptor. By getting the
feature/interceptor class name only specified, the container simply
tries to create a bean instance using the class default constructor.
This sets a limitation on the feature/interceptor configuration, unless
custom extensions of vanilla CXF classes are provided, with the default
constructor setting properties before eventually using the super
constructor.

To cope with this issue, JBossWS integration comes with a mechanism for
configuring simple bean hierarchies when building them up from
properties. Properties can have bean reference values, that is strings
starting with `##` . Property reference keys are used to specify the
bean class name and the value for each attribute. So for instance
the following properties:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Value
|cxf.features |##foo, ##bar
|##foo |org.jboss.Foo
|##foo.par |34
|##bar |org.jboss.Bar
|##bar.color |blue
|===

would result into the stack installing two feature instances, the same
that would have been created by

....
import org.Bar;
import org.Foo;

...

Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.setPar(34);
Bar bar = new Bar();
bar.setColor("blue");
....

The mechanism assumes that the classes are valid beans with proper
getter and setter methods; value objects are cast to the correct
primitive type by inspecting the class definition. Nested beans can of
course be configured.

==== HTTPConduit configuration

HTTP transport setup in Apache CXF is achieved through
`org.apache.cxf.transport.http.HTTPConduit`
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/client-http-transport-including-ssl-support.html[configurations]
. When running on top of the JBossWS integration, conduits can be
programmatically modified using the Apache CXF API as follows:

....
import org.apache.cxf.frontend.ClientProxy;
import org.apache.cxf.transport.http.HTTPConduit;
import org.apache.cxf.transports.http.configuration.HTTPClientPolicy;

//set chunking threshold before using a JAX-WS port client
...
HTTPConduit conduit = (HTTPConduit)ClientProxy.getClient(port).getConduit();
HTTPClientPolicy client = conduit.getClient();

client.setChunkingThreshold(8192);
...
....

Users can also control the default values for the most common
HTTPConduit parameters by setting specific system properties; the
provided values will override Apache CXF defaut values.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Description
|cxf.client.allowChunking |A boolean to tell Apache CXF whether to allow
send messages using chunking.

|cxf.client.chunkingThreshold |An integer value to tell Apache CXF the
threshold at which switching from non-chunking to chunking mode.

|cxf.client.connectionTimeout |A long value to tell Apache CXF how many
milliseconds to set the connection timeout to

|cxf.client.receiveTimeout |A long value to tell Apache CXF how many
milliseconds to set the receive timeout to

|cxf.client.connection |A string to tell Apache CXF to use `Keep-Alive`
or `close` connection type

|cxf.tls-client.disableCNCheck |A boolean to tell Apache CXF whether
disabling CN host name check or not
|===

The vanilla Apache CXF defaults apply when the system properties above
are not set.

=== Addressing

JBoss Web Services inherits full WS-Addressing capabilities from the
underlying Apache CXF implementation. Apache CXF provides support for
2004-08 and http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-core/[1.0] versions of
WS-Addressing.

==== Enabling WS-Addressing

WS-Addressing can be turned on in multiple standard ways:

* consuming a WSDL contract that specifies a WS-Addressing assertion /
policy
* using the `@jakarta.xml.ws.soap.Addressing` annotation
* using the `jakarta.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature` feature

[IMPORTANT]
====
The supported addressing policy elements are:

....
[http://www.w3.org/2005/02/addressing/wsdl]UsingAddressing
[http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing/policy]UsingAddressing
[http://www.w3.org/2006/05/addressing/wsdl]UsingAddressing
[http://www.w3.org/2007/05/addressing/metadata]Addressing
....
====

Alternatively, Apache CXF proprietary ways are also available:

* specifying the _[http://cxf.apache.org/ws/addressing]addressing_
feature for a given client/endpoint
* using the `org.apache.cxf.ws.addressing.WSAddressingFeature` feature
through the API
* manually configuring the Apache CXF addressing interceptors (
`org.apache.cxf.ws.addressing.MAPAggregator` and
`org.apache.cxf.ws.addressing.soap.MAPCodec` )
* setting the _org.apache.cxf.ws.addressing.using_ property in the
message context

Please refer to the Apache CXF documentation for further information
on the proprietary
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-addressing.html[WS-Addressing setup] and
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsaconfiguration.html[configuration details]
.

==== Addressing Policy

The WS-Addressing support is also perfectly integrated with the Apache
CXF WS-Policy engine.

This basically means that the WSDL contract generation for code-first
endpoint deployment is policy-aware: users can annotate endpoints with
the `@jakarta.xml.ws.soap.Addressing` annotation and expect the
published WSDL contract to contain proper WS-Addressing policy (assuming
no `wsdlLocation` is specified in the endpoint's `@WebService`
annotation).

Similarly, on client side users do not need to manually specify the
`jakarta.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature` feature, as the policy engine is
able to properly process the WS-Addressing policy in the consumed WSDL
and turn on addressing as requested.

==== Example

Here is an example showing how to enable WS-Addressing through
WS-Policy.

===== Endpoint

A simple JAX-WS endpoint is prepared using a java-first approach;
WS-Addressing is enforced through `@Addressing` annotation and no
`wsdlLocation` is provided in `@WebService` :

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsa;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import jakarta.xml.ws.soap.Addressing;
import org.jboss.logging.Logger;

@WebService
(
   portName = "AddressingServicePort",
   serviceName = "AddressingService",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wsaddressing",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsa.ServiceIface"
)
@Addressing(enabled=true, required=true)
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   private Logger log = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass());

   public String sayHello(String name)
   {
      return "Hello " + name + "!";
   }
}
....

The WSDL contract that's generated at deploy time and published looks
like this:

....
<wsdl:definitions ....>
...
  <wsdl:binding name="AddressingServiceSoapBinding" type="tns:ServiceIface">
    <soap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"/>
    <wsaw:UsingAddressing wsdl:required="true"/>
    <wsp:PolicyReference URI="#AddressingServiceSoapBinding_WSAM_Addressing_Policy"/>

    <wsdl:operation name="sayHello">
      <soap:operation soapAction="" style="document"/>
      <wsdl:input name="sayHello">
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </wsdl:input>
      <wsdl:output name="sayHelloResponse">
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </wsdl:output>
    </wsdl:operation>

  </wsdl:binding>
  <wsdl:service name="AddressingService">
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:AddressingServiceSoapBinding" name="AddressingServicePort">
      <soap:address location="http://localhost:8080/jaxws-samples-wsa"/>
    </wsdl:port>
  </wsdl:service>
    <wsp:Policy wsu:Id="AddressingServiceSoapBinding_WSAM_Addressing_Policy"
       xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd">
      <wsam:Addressing xmlns:wsam="http://www.w3.org/2007/05/addressing/metadata">
        <wsp:Policy/>
      </wsam:Addressing>
    </wsp:Policy>
</wsdl:definitions>
....


===== Client

Since the WS-Policy engine is on by default, the client side code is
a pure JAX-WS client app:

....
QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wsaddressing", "AddressingService");
URL wsdlURL = new URL("http://localhost:8080/jaxws-samples-wsa?wsdl");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
ServiceIface proxy = (ServiceIface)service.getPort(ServiceIface.class);
proxy.sayHello("World");
....


=== WS-Security


==== WS-Security overview

WS-Security provides the means to secure your services beyond transport
level protocols such as _HTTPS_ . Through a number of standards such as
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/[XML-Encryption] , and headers defined
in the
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wss[WS-Security]
standard, it allows you to:

* Pass authentication tokens between services.
* Encrypt messages or parts of messages.
* Sign messages.
* Timestamp messages.

WS-Security makes heavy use of public and private key cryptography. It
is helpful to understand the basics to understand how to
configure WS-Security. With public key cryptography, a user has a pair
of public and private keys. These are generated using a large prime
number and a key function.

image::Public_key_making.png[]

The keys are related mathematically, but cannot be derived from one
another. With these keys we can encrypt messages. For example, if Bob
wants to send a message to Alice, he can encrypt a message using her
public key. Alice can then decrypt this message using her private key.
Only Alice can decrypt this message as she is the only one with the
private key.

image::Public_key_encryption-mod.svg.png[]

Messages can also be signed. This allows you to ensure the authenticity
of the message. If Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and Bob wants
to be sure that it is from Alice, Alice can sign the message using her
private key. Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by using
her public key.

==== JBoss WS-Security support

JBoss Web Services supports many real world scenarios requiring
WS-Security functionalities. This includes signature and encryption
support through X509 certificates, authentication and authorization
through username tokens as well as all ws-security configurations
covered by WS-
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/v1.3/ws-securitypolicy.html[SecurityPolicy]
specification.

As well as for other WS-* features , the core of
WS-Security functionalities is provided through the Apache CXF engine.
On top of that the JBossWS integration adds few configuration
enhancements to simplify the setup of WS-Security enabled endpoints.


===== Apache CXF WS-Security implementation

Apache CXF features a top class WS-Security module supporting multiple
configurations and easily extendable.

The system is based on _interceptors_ that delegate to
http://ws.apache.org/wss4j[Apache WSS4J] for the low level security
operations. Interceptors can be configured in different ways, either
through Spring configuration files or directly using Apache CXF client
API. Please refer to the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html[Apache CXF documentation] if
you're looking for more details.

Recent versions of Apache CXF, however, introduced support for
WS-Security Policy, which aims at moving most of the security
configuration into the service contract (through policies), so that
clients can easily be configured almost completely automatically from
that. This way users do not need to manually deal with configuring /
installing the required interceptors; the Apache CXF WS-Policy engine
internally takes care of that instead.

====== WS-Security Policy support

WS-SecurityPolicy describes the actions that are required to securely
communicate with a service advertised in a given WSDL contract. The WSDL
bindings / operations reference WS-Policy fragments with the security
requirements to interact with the service. The
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/v1.3/ws-securitypolicy.html[WS-SecurityPolicy
specification] allows for specifying things like asymmetric/symmetric
keys, using transports (https) for encryption, which parts/headers to
encrypt or sign, whether to sign then encrypt or encrypt then sign,
whether to include timestamps, whether to use derived keys, etc.

Some mandatory configuration elements are not covered by
WS-SecurityPolicy, because they're not meant to be a public /
part of the published endpoint contract; those include things such as
keystore locations, usernames and passwords, etc. Apache CXF allows
configuring these elements either through Spring xml descriptors or
using the client API / annotations. Below is the list of supported
configuration properties:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|ws-security.username |The username used for UsernameToken policy
assertions
|ws-security.password |The password used for UsernameToken policy
assertions. If not specified, the callback handler will be called.

|ws-security.callback-handler |The WSS4J security CallbackHandler that
will be used to retrieve passwords for keystores and UsernameTokens.

|ws-security.signature.properties |The properties file/object that
contains the WSS4J properties for configuring the signature keystore and
crypto objects

|ws-security.encryption.properties |The properties file/object that
contains the WSS4J properties for configuring the encryption keystore
and crypto objects

|ws-security.signature.username |The username or alias for the key in
the signature keystore that will be used. If not specified, it uses the
the default alias set in the properties file. If that's also not set,
and the keystore only contains a single key, that key will be used.

|ws-security.encryption.username |The username or alias for the key in
the encryption keystore that will be used. If not specified, it uses the
the default alias set in the properties file. If that's also not set,
and the keystore only contains a single key, that key will be used. For
the web service provider, the useReqSigCert keyword can be used to
accept (encrypt to) any client whose public key is in the service's
truststore (defined in ws-security.encryption.properties.)

|ws-security.signature.crypto |Instead of specifying the signature
properties, this can point to the full
http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/apidocs/org/apache/ws/security/components/crypto/Crypto.html[WSS4J
Crypto] object. This can allow easier "programmatic" configuration of
the Crypto information."

|ws-security.encryption.crypto |Instead of specifying the encryption
properties, this can point to the full
http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/apidocs/org/apache/ws/security/components/crypto/Crypto.html[WSS4J
Crypto] object. This can allow easier "programmatic" configuration of
the Crypto information."

|ws-security.enable.streaming |Enable
http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/streaming.html[streaming] (StAX based)
processing of WS-Security messages
|===

Here is an example of configuration using the client API:

....
Map<String, Object> ctx = ((BindingProvider)port).getRequestContext();
ctx.put("ws-security.encryption.properties", properties);
port.echoString("hello");
....

Please refer to the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-securitypolicy.html[Apache CXF
documentation] for additional configuration details.

===== JBossWS configuration additions

In order for removing the need of Spring on server side for setting up
WS-Security configuration properties not covered by policies, the
JBossWS integration allows for getting those pieces of information from
a defined _endpoint configuration_ . <<Predefined client and endpoint configurations>>
can include property declarations and endpoint
implementations can be associated with a given endpoint configuration
using the `@EndpointConfig` annotation.

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

</jaxws-config>
....

....
import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.EndpointConfig;

@WebService
(
   portName = "SecurityServicePort",
   serviceName = "SecurityService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/SecurityService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.basic.ServiceIface"
)
@EndpointConfig(configFile = "WEB-INF/jaxws-endpoint-config.xml", configName = "Custom WS-Security Endpoint")
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Secure Hello World!";
   }
}
....

===== Apache CXF annotations

The JBossWS configuration additions allow for a descriptor approach to
the WS-Security Policy engine configuration. If you prefer to provide
the same information through an annotation approach, you can leverage
the Apache CXF `@org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperties`
annotation:

....
@WebService(
   ...
)
@EndpointProperties(value = {
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.properties", value = "bob.properties"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.encryption.properties", value = "bob.properties"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.username", value = "bob"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.encryption.username", value = "alice"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.callback-handler", value = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.basic.KeystorePasswordCallback")
      }
)
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface {
   ...
}
....


==== Examples

In this section a sample of WS-Security service endpoints and clients
are provided. Please note they're only meant as tutorials; you should
careful isolate the ws-security policies / assertion that best
suite your security needs before going to a production environment.

[WARNING]
====
The following sections provide directions and examples on understanding
some of the configuration options for WS-Security engine. Please note
the implementor remains responsible for assessing the application
requirements and choosing the most suitable security policy for them.
====

===== Signature and encryption

====== Endpoint

First, you need to create the web service endpoint using JAX-WS.
While this can generally be achieved in different ways, it's required to
use a contract-first approach when using WS-Security, as the policies
declared in the wsdl are parsed by the Apache CXF engine on both server
and client sides. Here is an example of WSDL contract enforcing
signature and encryption using X 509 certificates (the referenced schema
is omitted):

....

The service endpoint can be generated using the `wsconsume` tool and
then enriched with a `@EndpointConfig` annotation:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.basic;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.EndpointConfig;

@WebService
(
   portName = "SecurityServicePort",
   serviceName = "SecurityService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/SecurityService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.basic.ServiceIface"
)
@EndpointConfig(configFile = "WEB-INF/jaxws-endpoint-config.xml", configName = "Custom WS-Security Endpoint")
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Secure Hello World!";
   }
}
....

The referenced _jaxws-endpoint-config.xml_ descriptor is used to provide
a custom endpoint configuration with the required server side
configuration properties; this tells the engine which certificate / key
to use for signature / signature verification and for encryption /
decryption:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>Custom WS-Security Endpoint</config-name>
    <property>
      <property-name>ws-security.signature.properties</property-name>

    </property>
  </endpoint-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

... the _bob.properties_ configuration file is also referenced above; it
includes the WSS4J Crypto properties which in turn link to the keystore
file, type and the alias/password to use for accessing it:

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=password
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias=bob
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=bob.jks
....

A callback handler for the letting Apache CXF access the keystore is
also provided:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.basic;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback;

public class KeystorePasswordCallback implements CallbackHandler {
   private Map<String, String> passwords = new HashMap<String, String>();

   public KeystorePasswordCallback() {
      passwords.put("alice", "password");
      passwords.put("bob", "password");
   }

   /**
    * It attempts to get the password from the private
    * alias/passwords map.
    */
   public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
      for (int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {
         WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback)callbacks[i];

         String pass = passwords.get(pc.getIdentifier());
         if (pass != null) {
            pc.setPassword(pass);
            return;
         }
      }
   }

   /**
    * Add an alias/password pair to the callback mechanism.
    */
   public void setAliasPassword(String alias, String password) {
      passwords.put(alias, password);
   }
}
....

Assuming the _bob.jks_ keystore has been properly generated and contains
Bob's (server) full key (private/certificate + public key) as well as
Alice's (client) public key, we can proceed to packaging the endpoint.
Here is the expected content (the endpoint is a _POJO_ one in a _war_
archive, but _EJB3_ endpoints in _jar_ archives are of course also
supported):

The jaxws classes generated by the tools are included, as well as a basic _web.xml_ referencing the endpoint
bean:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app
   version="2.5" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd">

      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>

....

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you're deploying the endpoint archive to WildFly, remember to add a
dependency to _org.apache.ws.security_ module in the MANIFEST.MF file.

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.7.1
Created-By: 17.0-b16 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
Dependencies: org.apache.ws.security
....
====

====== Client

Start by consuming the published WSDL contract using the _wsconsume_
tool on client side, then simply invoke the endpoint as a
standard JAX-WS one:

....
QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy", "SecurityService");
URL wsdlURL = new URL(serviceURL + "?wsdl");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
ServiceIface proxy = (ServiceIface)service.getPort(ServiceIface.class);

((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER, new KeystorePasswordCallback());
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_PROPERTIES,
     Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource("META-INF/alice.properties"));
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES,
     Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource("META-INF/alice.properties"));
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_USERNAME, "alice");
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME, "bob");

proxy.sayHello();
....

The WS-Security properties are set in the request
context. Here the `KeystorePasswordCallback` is the same as on the server
side above, you might want/need different implementation in real world
scenarios. The _alice.properties_ file is the client side
equivalent of the server side _bob.properties_ and references the
_alice.jks_ keystore file, which has been populated with Alice's
(client) full key (private/certificate + public key) as well as Bob's
(server) public key.

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=password
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias=alice
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=META-INF/alice.jks
....

The Apache CXF WS-Policy engine will digest the security requirements in
the contract and ensure a valid secure communication is in place for
interacting with the server endpoint.

====== Endpoint serving multiple clients

The server side configuration described above implies the endpoint is
configured for serving a given client which a service agreement has been
established for. In some real world scenarios, the same server
might be expected to be able to deal with (including decrypting and
encrypting) messages coming from and being sent to multiple clients.
Apache CXF supports that through the `useReqSigCert` value for the
`ws-security.encryption.username` configuration parameter.

Of course the referenced server side keystore needs to contain the
public key of all the clients that are expected to be served.

===== Authentication and authorization

The Username Token Profile can be used to provide client's credentials
to a WS-Security enabled target endpoint.

Apache CXF provides a means for setting basic _password callback handlers_
on both client and server sides to set/check passwords; the
_ws-security.username_ and _ws-security.callback-handler_ properties can
be used similarly as shown in the signature and encryption example.
Things become more interesting when requiring a given user to be
authenticated (and authorized) against a security domain on the target
WildFly server.

On the server side, you need to install two additional interceptors that act
as bridges for the application server authentication layer:

* an interceptor for performing authentication and populating a valid
SecurityContext; the provided interceptor should extend
org.apache.cxf.ws.interceptor.security.AbstractUsernameTokenInInterceptor,
in particular JBossWS integration comes with
_org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.security.authentication.SubjectCreatingInterceptor_
for this;
* an interceptor for performing authorization; CXF requires that to
extend
org.apache.cxf.interceptor.security.AbstractAuthorizingInInterceptor,
for instance the _SimpleAuthorizingInterceptor_ can be used for simply
mapping endpoint operations to allowed roles.

Here follows an example of WS-SecurityPolicy endpoint using Username
Token Profile for authenticating through the WildFly security domain
system.

====== Endpoint

As in the other example, we start with a wsdl contract containing the
proper WS-Security Policy:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to send hash / digest passwords, you can use a policy such
as what follows:

....
<wsp:Policy wsu:Id="SecurityServiceUsernameHashPasswordPolicy">
    <wsp:ExactlyOne>
        <wsp:All>
            <sp:SupportingTokens xmlns:sp="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702">
                <wsp:Policy>
                    <sp:UsernameToken sp:IncludeToken="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient">
                        <wsp:Policy>
                            <sp:HashPassword/>
                        </wsp:Policy>
                    </sp:UsernameToken>
                </wsp:Policy>
            </sp:SupportingTokens>
        </wsp:All>
    </wsp:ExactlyOne>
</wsp:Policy>
....

Please note the specified JBoss security domain needs to be properly
configured for computing digests.
====

The service endpoint can be generated using the `wsconsume` tool and
then enriched with a `@EndpointConfig` annotation and `@InInterceptors`
annotation to add the two interceptors mentioned above for JAAS
integration:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.InInterceptors;
import org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.EndpointConfig;

@WebService
(
   portName = "SecurityServicePort",
   serviceName = "SecurityService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/SecurityService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas.ServiceIface"
)
@EndpointConfig(configFile = "WEB-INF/jaxws-endpoint-config.xml", configName = "Custom WS-Security Endpoint")
@InInterceptors(interceptors = {
      "org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.security.authentication.SubjectCreatingPolicyInterceptor",
      "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas.POJOEndpointAuthorizationInterceptor"}
)
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Secure Hello World!";
   }

   public String greetMe()
   {
      return "Greetings!";
   }
}
....

The `POJOEndpointAuthorizationInterceptor` is included into the
deployment and deals with the roles cheks:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import org.apache.cxf.interceptor.security.SimpleAuthorizingInterceptor;

public class POJOEndpointAuthorizationInterceptor extends SimpleAuthorizingInterceptor
{

   public POJOEndpointAuthorizationInterceptor()
   {
      super();
      readRoles();
   }

   private void readRoles()
   {
      //just an example, this might read from a configuration file or such
      Map<String, String> roles = new HashMap<String, String>();
      roles.put("sayHello", "friend");
      roles.put("greetMe", "snoopies");
      setMethodRolesMap(roles);
   }
}
....

The _jaxws-endpoint-config.xml_ descriptor is used to provide a custom
endpoint configuration with the required server side configuration
properties; in particular for this Username Token case that's just a CXF
configuration option for leaving the username token validation to the
configured interceptors:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee" xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">
  <endpoint-config>
    <config-name>Custom WS-Security Endpoint</config-name>
    <property>
      <property-name>ws-security.validate.token</property-name>
      <property-value>false</property-value>
    </property>
  </endpoint-config>
</jaxws-config>
....

In order for requiring a given JBoss security domain to be used to
protect access to the endpoint (a POJO one in this case), we declare
that in a _jboss-web.xml_ descriptor (the _JBossWS_ security domain is
used):

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE jboss-web PUBLIC "-//JBoss//DTD Web Application 2.4//EN" "http://www.jboss.org/j2ee/dtd/jboss-web_4_0.dtd">
<jboss-web>
   <security-domain>java:/jaas/JBossWS</security-domain>
</jboss-web
....

Finally, the _web.xml_ is as simple as usual:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app
   version="2.5" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd">
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>TestService</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas.ServiceImpl</servlet-class>
   </servlet>
   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>TestService</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
....

The endpoint is packaged into a war archive, including the JAXWS classes
generated by wsconsume:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you're deploying the endpoint archive to WildFly, remember to add a

to the `@InInterceptor` annotation) in the MANIFEST.MF file.

....

====== Client

Start by consuming the published WSDL contract using the
_wsconsume_ tool, then invoke the the endpoint as a standard
JAX-WS one:

....
QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy", "SecurityService");
URL wsdlURL = new URL(serviceURL + "?wsdl");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
ServiceIface proxy = (ServiceIface)service.getPort(ServiceIface.class);

((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.USERNAME, "kermit");
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER,
      "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas.UsernamePasswordCallback");

proxy.sayHello();
....

The `UsernamePasswordCallback` class is shown below and is responsible
for setting the passwords on client side just before performing the
invocations:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.jaas;

      WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback)callbacks[0];
      if ("kermit".equals(pc.getIdentifier()))
         pc.setPassword("thefrog");
   }
}
....

If everything has been done properly, you should expect calls to
`sayHello()` to fail when done with user "snoopy" and pass with user
"kermit" (and credential "thefrog"); moreover, you should get an
authorization error when trying to call `greetMe()` with user "kermit",
as that does not have the "snoopies" role.

===== Secure transport

Another quite common use case is using WS-Security Username Token
Profile over a secure transport (HTTPS). A scenario like this is
implemented similarly to what's described in the previous example,
except for few differences explained below.

Here is an excerpt of a wsdl with a sample security policy
for Username Token over HTTPS:

....
...

<binding name="SecurityServicePortBinding" type="tns:ServiceIface">
  <wsp:PolicyReference URI="#SecurityServiceBindingPolicy"/>
  <soap:binding transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" style="document"/>
  <operation name="sayHello">
    <soap:operation soapAction=""/>
    <input>
      <soap:body use="literal"/>
    </input>
    <output>
      <soap:body use="literal"/>
    </output>
  </operation>
</binding>
<service name="SecurityService">
   <port name="SecurityServicePort" binding="tns:SecurityServicePortBinding">
      <soap:address location="https://localhost:8443/jaxws-samples-wsse-policy-username"/>
   </port>
</service>

<wsp:Policy wsu:Id="SecurityServiceBindingPolicy">
   <wsp:ExactlyOne>
      <wsp:All>
         <foo:unknownPolicy xmlns:foo="http://cxf.apache.org/not/a/policy"/>
      </wsp:All>
      <wsp:All>
         <wsaws:UsingAddressing xmlns:wsaws="http://www.w3.org/2006/05/addressing/wsdl"/>
         <sp:TransportBinding>
            <wsp:Policy>
               <sp:TransportToken>
                  <wsp:Policy>
                     <sp:HttpsToken RequireClientCertificate="false"/>
                  </wsp:Policy>
               </sp:TransportToken>
               <sp:Layout>
                  <wsp:Policy>
                     <sp:Lax/>
                  </wsp:Policy>
               </sp:Layout>
               <sp:IncludeTimestamp/>
               <sp:AlgorithmSuite>
                  <wsp:Policy>
                     <sp:Basic128/>
                  </wsp:Policy>
               </sp:AlgorithmSuite>
            </wsp:Policy>
         </sp:TransportBinding>
         <sp:Wss10>
            <wsp:Policy>
               <sp:MustSupportRefKeyIdentifier/>
            </wsp:Policy>
         </sp:Wss10>
         <sp:SignedSupportingTokens>
            <wsp:Policy>
               <sp:UsernameToken sp:IncludeToken="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient">
                  <wsp:Policy>
                     <sp:WssUsernameToken10/>
                  </wsp:Policy>
               </sp:UsernameToken>
            </wsp:Policy>
         </sp:SignedSupportingTokens>
      </wsp:All>
   </wsp:ExactlyOne>
</wsp:Policy>
....

The endpoint needs to be available on HTTPS
only, so we have a _web.xml_ setting the _transport-guarantee_ such as
below:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app
   version="5.0" xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"

===== Secure conversation

Apache CXF supports
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-secureconversation/200512/ws-secureconversation-1.3-os.html[WS-SecureConversation]
specification, which is about improving performance by allowing client
and server to negotiate initial security keys to be used for later
communication encryption/signature. This is done by having two policies
in the wsdl contract, an outer one setting the security requirements to
communicate with the endpoint and a bootstrap one, related to
the communication for establishing the secure conversation keys. The
client will be automatically sending an initial message to the server
for negotiating the keys, then the communication to the endpoint
takes place. As a consequence, Apache CXF needs a way to specify which
WS-Security configuration properties are intended for the bootstrap
policy and which are intended for the actual service policy. To
accomplish this, properties intended for the bootstrap policy are
appended with `.sct` .

....
...
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put("ws-security.signature.username.sct", "alice");
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put("ws-security.encryption.username.sct", "bob");
...
....

....
@WebService(
   ...
)
@EndpointProperties(value = {
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.encryption.properties.sct", value = "bob.properties"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.properties.sct", value = "bob.properties"),
      ...
      }
)
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface {

=== WS-Trust and STS

==== WS-Trust overview

http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/v1.4/ws-trust.html[WS-Trust] is a Web
service specification that defines extensions to WS-Security. It is a
general framework for implementing security in a distributed system. The
standard is based on a centralized Security Token Service, STS, which is
capable of authenticating clients and issuing tokens containing various
kinds of authentication and authorization data. The specification
describes a protocol used for issuance, exchange, and validation of
security tokens, however the following specifications play an important
role in the WS-Trust architecture:
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702/ws-securitypolicy-1.2-spec-os.html[WS-SecurityPolicy
1.2] ,
http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf[SAML
2.0] ,
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/v1.1/wss-v1.1-spec-os-UsernameTokenProfile.pdf[Username
Token Profile] ,
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss-m/wss/v1.1.1/wss-x509TokenProfile-v1.1.1.html[X.509
Token Profile] ,
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16768/wss-v1.1-spec-os-SAMLTokenProfile.pdf[SAML
Token Profile] , and
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/v1.1/wss-v1.1-spec-os-KerberosTokenProfile.pdf[Kerberos
Token Profile] .

The WS-Trust extensions address the needs of applications that span
multiple domains and requires the sharing of security keys by providing
a standards based trusted third party web service (STS) to broker trust
relationships between a Web service requester and a Web service
provider. This architecture also alleviates the pain of service updates
that require credential changes by providing a common location for this
information. The STS is the common access point from which both the
requester and provider retrieves and verifies security tokens.

There are three main components of the WS-Trust specification.

* The Security Token Service (STS), a web service that issues, renews,
and validates security tokens.
* The message formats for security token requests and responses.
* The mechanisms for key exchange

==== Security Token Service

The Security Token Service, STS, is the core of the WS-Trust
specification. It is a standards based mechanism for authentication and
authorization. The STS is an implementation of the WS-Trust
specification's protocol for issuing, exchanging, and validating
security tokens, based on token format, namespace, or trust boundaries.
The STS is a web service that acts as a trusted third party to broker
trust relationships between a Web service requester and a Web service
provider. It is a common access point trusted by both requester and
provider to provide interoperable security tokens. It removes the need
for a direct relationship between the two. Because the STS is a
standards based mechanism for authentication, it helps ensure
interoperability across realms and between different platforms.

The STS's WSDL contract defines how other applications and processes
interact with it. In particular the WSDL defines the WS-Trust and
WS-Security policies that a requester must fulfill in order to
successfully communicate with the STS's endpoints. A web service
requester consumes the STS's WSDL and with the aid of an STSClient
utility, generates a message request compliant with the stated security
policies and submits it to the STS endpoint. The STS validates the
request and returns an appropriate response.

==== Apache CXF support

Apache CXF is an open-source, fully featured Web services framework. The
JBossWS open source project integrates the JBoss Web Services (JBossWS)
stack with the Apache CXF project modules thus providing WS-Trust and
other JAX-WS functionality in WildFly. This integration makes it easy to
deploy CXF STS implementations, however WildFly can run any WS-Trust
compliant STS. In addition the Apache CXF API provides a STSClient
utility to facilitate web service requester communication with its STS.

Detailed information about the Apache CXF's WS-Trust implementation can
be found
http://coheigea.blogspot.it/2011/10/apache-cxf-sts-documentation-part-i.html[here]
.

==== A Basic WS-Trust Scenario

Here is an example of a basic WS-Trust scenario. It is comprised of a
Web service requester (ws-requester), a Web service provider
(ws-provider), and a Security Token Service (STS). The ws-provider
requires a SAML 2.0 token issued from a designed STS to be presented by
the ws-requester using asymmetric binding. These communication
requirements are declared in the ws-provider's WSDL. The STS requires
ws-requester credentials be provided in a WSS UsernameToken format
request using symmetric binding. The STS's response is provided
containing a SAML 2.0 token. These communication requirements are
declared in the STS's WSDL.

[arabic]
. A ws-requester contacts the ws-provider and consumes its WSDL. Upon
finding the security token issuer requirement, it creates and configures
a STSClient with the information it requires to generate a proper
request.
. The STSClient contacts the STS and consumes its WSDL. The security
policies are discovered. The STSClient creates and sends an
authentication request, with appropriate credentials.
. The STS verifies the credentials.
. In response, the STS issues a security token that provides proof that
the ws-requester has authenticated with the STS.
. The STClient presents a message with the security token to the
ws-provider.
. The ws-provider verifies the token was issued by the STS, thus proving
the ws-requester has successfully authenticated with the STS.
. The ws-provider executes the requested service and returns the results
to the the ws-requester.

===== Web service provider

This section examines the crucial elements in providing endpoint
security in the web service provider described in the basic WS-Trust
scenario. The components that will be discussed are.

* web service provider's WSDL
* web service provider's Interface and Implementation classes.
* ServerCallbackHandler class
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF

====== Web service provider WSDL

The web service provider is a contract-first endpoint. All the WS-trust
and security policies for it are declared in the WSDL,
SecurityService.wsdl. For this scenario a ws-requester is required to
present a SAML 2.0 token issued from a designed STS. The address of the
STS is provided in the WSDL. An asymmetric binding policy is used to
encrypt and sign the SOAP body of messages that pass back and forth
between ws-requester and ws-provider. X.509 certificates are use for the
asymmetric binding. The rules for sharing the public and private keys in
the SOAP request and response messages are declared. A detailed
explanation of the security settings are provided in the comments in the
listing below.

====== Web service provider Interface

The web service provider interface class, ServiceIface, is a
straight forward web service definition.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.service;

import jakarta.jws.WebMethod;
import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy"
)
public interface ServiceIface
{
   @WebMethod
   String sayHello();
}
....

====== Web service provider Implementation

The web service provider implementation class, ServiceImpl, is a simple
POJO. It uses the standard WebService annotation to define the service
endpoint. There are two Apache CXF annotations,
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty used for configuring the
endpoint for the CXF runtime. These annotations come from the
https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/[Apache WSS4J project] , which provides a
Java implementation of the primary WS-Security standards for Web
Services. These annotations are programmatically adding properties to
the endpoint. With plain Apache CXF, these properties are often set via
the <jaxws:properties> element on the <jaxws:endpoint> element in the
Spring config; these annotations allow the properties to be configured
in the code.

WSS4J uses the Crypto interface to get keys and certificates for
encryption/decryption and for signature creation/verification. As is
asserted by the WSDL, X509 keys and certificates are required for this
service. The WSS4J configuration information being provided by
ServiceImpl is for Crypto's Merlin implementation. More information will
be provided about this in the keystore section.

The first EndpointProperty statement in the listing is declaring the
user's name to use for the message signature. It is used as the alias
name in the keystore to get the user's cert and private key for
signature. The next two EndpointProperty statements declares the Java
properties file that contains the (Merlin) crypto configuration
information. In this case both for signing and encrypting the messages.
WSS4J reads this file and extra required information for message
handling. The last EndpointProperty statement declares the
ServerCallbackHandler implementation class. It is used to obtain the
user's password for the certificates in the keystore file.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.service;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperties;
import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperty;

@WebService
(
   portName = "SecurityServicePort",
   serviceName = "SecurityService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/SecurityService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.service.ServiceIface"
)
@EndpointProperties(value = {
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.username", value = "myservicekey"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.properties", value = "serviceKeystore.properties"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.encryption.properties", value = "serviceKeystore.properties"),
      @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.callback-handler", value = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.service.ServerCallbackHandler")
})
public class ServiceImpl implements ServiceIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "WS-Trust Hello World!";
   }
}
....

====== ServerCallbackHandler

ServerCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It
is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use for
the message signature. A certificates' password is not discoverable. The
creator of the certificate must record the password he assigns and
provide it when requested through the CallbackHandler. In this scenario
skpass is the password for user myservicekey.

....
 package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.service;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.extensions.security.PasswordCallbackHandler;

public class ServerCallbackHandler extends PasswordCallbackHandler
{

   public ServerCallbackHandler()
   {
      super(getInitMap());
   }

   private static Map<String, String> getInitMap()
   {
      Map<String, String> passwords = new HashMap<String, String>();
      passwords.put("myservicekey", "skpass");
      return passwords;
   }
}
....

====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File serviceKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=sspass
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias=myservicekey
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=servicestore.jks
....


====== MANIFEST.MF

When deployed on WildFly this application requires access to the JBossWS
and Apache CXF APIs provided in module
org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client. The dependency statement directs
the server to provide them at deployment.

....

===== Security Token Service (STS)

This section examines the crucial elements in providing the Security
Token Service functionality described in the basic WS-Trust scenario.
The components that will be discussed are.

* STS's WSDL
* STS's implementation class.
* STSCallbackHandler class
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF
* Server configuration files


====== STS WSDL

The STS is a contract-first endpoint. All the WS-trust and security
policies for it are declared in the WSDL, ws-trust-1.4-service.wsdl. A
symmetric binding policy is used to encrypt and sign the SOAP body of
messages that pass back and forth between ws-requester and the STS. The
ws-requester is required to authenticate itself by providing WSS
UsernameToken credentials. The rules for sharing the public and private
keys in the SOAP request and response messages are declared. A detailed
explanation of the security settings is provided in the comments in the
listing below.

====== STS Implementation

The Apache CXF's STS, SecurityTokenServiceProvider, is a web service
provider that is compliant with the protocols and functionality defined
by the WS-Trust specification. It has a modular architecture. Many of
its components are configurable or replaceable and there are many
optional features that are enabled by implementing and configuring
plug-ins. Users can customize their own STS by extending from
SecurityTokenServiceProvider and overriding the default settings.
Extensive information about the CXF's STS configurable and pluggable
components can be found
http://coheigea.blogspot.com/2011/11/apache-cxf-sts-documentation-part-viii_10.html[here]
.

This STS implementation class, SimpleSTS, is a POJO that extends from
SecurityTokenServiceProvider. Note that the class is defined with a
WebServiceProvider annotation and not a WebService annotation. This
annotation defines the service as a Provider-based endpoint, meaning it
supports a more messaging-oriented approach to Web services. In
particular, it signals that the exchanged messages will be XML documents
of some type. SecurityTokenServiceProvider is an implementation of the
jakarta.xml.ws.Provider interface. In comparison the WebService annotation
defines a (service endpoint interface) SEI-based endpoint which supports
message exchange via SOAP envelopes.

As was done in the ServiceImpl class, the WSS4J annotations
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty are providing endpoint
configuration for the CXF runtime. This was previous described
<<Web service provider Implementation>>
.

The InInterceptors annotation is used to specify a JBossWS integration
interceptor to be used for authenticating incoming requests; JAAS
integration is used here for authentication, the username/passoword
coming from the UsernameToken in the ws-requester message are used for
authenticating the requester against a security domain on the
application server hosting the STS deployment.

In this implementation we are customizing the operations of token
issuance, token validation and their static properties.

StaticSTSProperties is used to set select properties for configuring
resources in the STS. You may think this is a duplication of the
settings made with the WSS4J annotations. The values are the same but
the underlaying structures being set are different, thus this
information must be declared in both places.

The setIssuer setting is important because it uniquely identifies the
issuing STS. The issuer string is embedded in issued tokens and, when
validating tokens, the STS checks the issuer string value. Consequently,
it is important to use the issuer string in a consistent way, so that
the STS can recognize the tokens that it has issued.

The setEndpoints call allows the declaration of a set of allowed token
recipients by address. The addresses are specified as reg-ex patterns.

TokenIssueOperation and TokenValidateOperation have a modular structure.
This allows custom behaviors to be injected into the processing of
messages. In this case we are overriding the
SecurityTokenServiceProvider's default behavior and performing SAML
token processing and validation. CXF provides an implementation of a
SAMLTokenProvider and SAMLTokenValidator which we are using rather than
writing our own.

====== STSCallbackHandler

STSCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It is
used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use for
the message signature.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.sts;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.extensions.security.PasswordCallbackHandler;

public class STSCallbackHandler extends PasswordCallbackHandler
{
   public STSCallbackHandler()
   {
      super(getInitMap());
   }

   private static Map<String, String> getInitMap()
   {
      Map<String, String> passwords = new HashMap<String, String>();
      passwords.put("mystskey", "stskpass");
      return passwords;
   }
}
....


====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File stsKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin  
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=stsspass
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=stsstore.jks
....


====== MANIFEST.MF

When deployed on WildFly, this application requires access to the
JBossWS and Apache CXF APIs provided in module
org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client. The org.jboss.ws.cxf.sts module is
also needed to build the STS configuration in the `SampleSTS`
constructor. The dependency statement directs the server to provide them
at deployment.

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0  
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.8.2  
Created-By: 1.7.0_25-b15 (Oracle Corporation)  
Dependencies: org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client,org.jboss.ws.cxf.sts
....


====== Security Domain

The STS requires a JBoss security domain be configured. The
jboss-web.xml descriptor declares a named security
domain,"JBossWS-trust-sts" to be used by this service for
authentication. This security domain requires two properties files and
the addition of a security-domain declaration in the JBoss server
configuration file.

For this scenario the domain needs to contain user _alice_ , password
_clarinet_ , and role _friend_ . See the listings below for
jbossws-users.properties and jbossws-roles.properties. The
following XML must be added to the JBoss security subsystem in the
server configuration file. Replace " *SOME_PATH* " with appropriate
information.

....
 <security-domain name="JBossWS-trust-sts">
  <authentication>
    <login-module code="UsersRoles" flag="required">
      <module-option name="usersProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-users.properties"/>
      <module-option name="unauthenticatedIdentity" value="anonymous"/>
      <module-option name="rolesProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-roles.properties"/>
    </login-module>
  </authentication>
</security-domain>
....

jboss-web.xml

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE jboss-web PUBLIC "-//JBoss//DTD Web Application 2.4//EN" ">  
<jboss-web>  
  <security-domain>java:/jaas/JBossWS-trust-sts</security-domain>  
</jboss-web>
....

jbossws-users.properties

....
# A sample users.properties file for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule  
alice=clarinet
....

jbossws-roles.properties

....
# A sample roles.properties file for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule  
alice=friend
....

[TIP]
.WS-MetadataExchange and interoperability
====
To achieve better interoperability, you might consider allowing the STS
endpoint to reply to WS-MetadataExchange messages directed to the `/mex`
URL sub-path (e.g.
http://localhost:8080/jaxws-samples-wsse-policy-trust-sts/SecurityTokenService/mex[]
). This can be done by tweaking the _url-pattern_ for the underlying
endpoint servlet, for instance by adding a _web.xml_ descriptor as
follows to the deployment:
....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app version="5.0" xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee""
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/web-app_5_0.xsd"> <servlet>
<servlet-name>TestSecurityTokenService</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.SampleSTS</servlet-class>
</servlet> <servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>TestSecurityTokenService</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/SecurityTokenService/*</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
....
At the time of writing some webservices
implementations (including _Metro_ ) assume the `/mex` URL as the
default choice for directing WS-MetadataExchange requests to and use
that to retrieve STS wsdl contracts.

===== Web service requester

This section examines the crucial elements in calling a web service that
implements endpoint security as described in the basic WS-Trust
scenario. The components that will be discussed are.

* web service requestor's implementation
* ClientCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files


====== Web service requester Implementation

The ws-requester, the client, uses standard procedures for creating a
reference to the web service in the first four line. To address the
endpoint security requirements, the web service's "Request Context" is
configured with the information needed in message generation.
The STSClient that communicates with the STS is configured
with similar values. Note the key strings ending with a ".it" suffix.
This suffix flags these settings as belonging to the STSClient. The
internal CXF code assigns this information to the STSClient that is
auto-generated for this service call.

There is an alternate method of setting up the STSCLient. The user may
provide their own instance of the STSClient. The CXF code will use this
object and not auto-generate one. This is used in the ActAs and
OnBehalfOf examples. When providing the STSClient in this way, the user
must provide a org.apache.cxf.Bus for it and the configuration keys must
not have the ".it" suffix.

....
QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wssecuritypolicy", "SecurityService");  
URL wsdlURL = new URL(serviceURL + "?wsdl");  
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);  
ServiceIface proxy = (ServiceIface) service.getPort(ServiceIface.class);  
 
// set the security related configuration information for the service "request"  
Map<String, Object> ctx = ((BindingProvider) proxy).getRequestContext();  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER, new ClientCallbackHandler());  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_PROPERTIES,
   Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
   "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES,
   Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
   "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_USERNAME, "myclientkey");  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME, "myservicekey");  
 
 
//-- Configuration settings that will be transfered to the STSClient  
// "alice" is the name provided for the WSS Username. Her password will  
// be retreived from the ClientCallbackHander by the STSClient.  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.USERNAME + ".it", "alice");  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER + ".it", new ClientCallbackHandler());  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES + ".it",
   Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
   "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME + ".it", "mystskey");  
// alias name in the keystore to get the user's public key to send to the STS  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_USERNAME + ".it", "myclientkey");  
// Crypto property configuration to use for the STS  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_PROPERTIES + ".it",
   Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
   "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));  
// write out an X509Certificate structure in UseKey/KeyInfo  
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_USE_CERT_FOR_KEYINFO + ".it", "true");  
// Setting indicates the  STSclient should not try using the WS-MetadataExchange  
// call using STS EPR WSA address when the endpoint contract does not contain  
// WS-MetadataExchange info.  
ctx.put("ws-security.sts.disable-wsmex-call-using-epr-address", "true");  
   
proxy.sayHello();
....


====== ClientCallbackHandler

ClientCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It
is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use for
the message signature. Note that "alice" and her password have been
provided here. This information is not in the (JKS) keystore but
provided in the WildFly security domain. It was declared in file
jbossws-users.properties.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.shared;  
 
import java.io.IOException;  
import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback;  
import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler;  
import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException;  
import org.apache.ws.security.WSPasswordCallback;  
 
public class ClientCallbackHandler implements CallbackHandler {  
 
    public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException,  
            UnsupportedCallbackException {  
        for (int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {  
            if (callbacks[i] instanceof WSPasswordCallback) {  
                WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback) callbacks[i];  
                if ("myclientkey".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {  
                    pc.setPassword("ckpass");  
                    break;  
                } else if ("alice".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {  
                    pc.setPassword("clarinet");  
                    break;  
                }  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}
....


====== Requester Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File clientKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File clientstore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

....

org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=META-INF/clientstore.jks
....

==== ActAs WS-Trust Scenario

The ActAs feature is used in scenarios that require composite
delegation. It is commonly used in multi-tiered systems where an
application calls a service on behalf of a logged in user or a service
calls another service on behalf of the original caller.

ActAs is nothing more than a new sub-element in the RequestSecurityToken
(RST). It provides additional information about the original caller when
a token is negotiated with the STS. The ActAs element usually takes the
form of a token with identity claims such as name, role, and
authorization code, for the client to access the service.

The ActAs scenario is an extension of <<A Basic WS-Trust Scenario>>. In this example the ActAs service calls the
ws-service on behalf of a user. There are only a couple of additions to
the basic scenario's code. An ActAs web service provider and callback
handler have been added. The ActAs web services' WSDL imposes the same
security policies as the ws-provider. UsernameTokenCallbackHandler is
new. It is a utility that generates the content for the ActAs element.
And lastly there are a couple of code additions in the STS to support
the ActAs request.


===== Web service provider

This section examines the web service elements from the basic WS-Trust
scenario that have been changed to address the needs of the ActAs
example. The components are

* ActAs web service provider's WSDL
* ActAs web service provider's Interface and Implementation classes.
* ActAsCallbackHandler class
* UsernameTokenCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF


====== Web service provider WSDL

The ActAs web service provider's WSDL is a clone of the ws-provider's
WSDL. The wsp:Policy section is the same. There are changes to the
service endpoint, targetNamespace, portType, binding name, and service.

====== Web Service Interface

The web service provider interface class, ActAsServiceIface, is a simple
web service definition.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.actas;

import jakarta.jws.WebMethod;
import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/actaswssecuritypolicy"
)
public interface ActAsServiceIface
{
   @WebMethod
   String sayHello();
}
....


====== Web Service Implementation

The web service provider implementation class, ActAsServiceImpl, is a
POJO. It uses the standard WebService annotation to define the
service endpoint and two Apache WSS4J annotations, EndpointProperties
and EndpointProperty used for configuring the endpoint for the CXF
runtime. The WSS4J configuration information provided is for WSS4J's
Crypto Merlin implementation.

ActAsServiceImpl is calling ServiceImpl acting on behalf of the user.
Method setupService performs the requisite configuration setup.

====== ActAsCallbackHandler

ActAsCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It
is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use for
the message signature. This class has been revised to return the
passwords for this service, myactaskey and the "actas" user, alice.

The declaration of the set of allowed token recipients by address has
been extended to accept ActAs addresses and OnBehalfOf addresses. The
addresses are specified as reg-ex patterns.

The TokenIssueOperation requires class, UsernameTokenValidator be
provided in order to validate the contents of the OnBehalfOf claims and
class, UsernameTokenDelegationHandler to be provided in order to process
the token delegation request of the ActAs on OnBehalfOf user.

===== Web service requester

This section examines the ws-requester elements from the basic WS-Trust
scenario that have been changed to address the needs of the ActAs
example. The component is

* ActAs web service requester implementation class


====== Web service requester Implementation

The ActAs ws-requester, the client, uses standard procedures for
creating a reference to the web service in the first four lines. To
address the endpoint security requirements, the web service's "Request
Context" is configured via the BindingProvider. Information needed in
the message generation is provided through it. The ActAs user,
myactaskey, is declared in this section and UsernameTokenCallbackHandler
is used to provide the contents of the ActAs element to the STSClient.
In this example a STSClient object is created and provided to the
proxy's request context. The alternative is to provide keys tagged with
the ".it" suffix as was done in
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS/WS-Trust+and+STS#WS-TrustandSTS-WebservicerequesterImplementation[the
Basic Scenario client] . The use of ActAs is configured through the
props map using the SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_ACT_AS key. The
alternative is to use the STSClient.setActAs method.

....


==== OnBehalfOf WS-Trust Scenario

The OnBehalfOf feature is used in scenarios that use the proxy pattern.
In such scenarios, the client cannot access the STS directly, instead it
communicates through a proxy gateway. The proxy gateway authenticates
the caller and puts information about the caller into the OnBehalfOf
element of the RequestSecurityToken (RST) sent to the real STS for
processing. The resulting token contains only claims related to the
client of the proxy, making the proxy completely transparent to the
receiver of the issued token.

OnBehalfOf is nothing more than a new sub-element in the RST. It
provides additional information about the original caller when a token
is negotiated with the STS. The OnBehalfOf element usually takes the
form of a token with identity claims such as name, role, and
authorization code, for the client to access the service.

The OnBehalfOf scenario is an extension of <<A Basic WS-Trust Scenario>> . In this example the OnBehalfOf service calls the
ws-service on behalf of a user. There are only a couple of additions to
the basic scenario's code. An OnBehalfOf web service provider and
callback handler have been added. The OnBehalfOf web services' WSDL
imposes the same security policies as the ws-provider.
UsernameTokenCallbackHandler is a utility shared with ActAs. It
generates the content for the OnBehalfOf element. Lastly there are
code additions in the STS that both OnBehalfOf and ActAs share in
common.

===== Web service provider

This section examines the web service elements from the basic WS-Trust
scenario that have been changed to address the needs of the OnBehalfOf
example. The components are.

* web service provider's WSDL
* web service provider's Interface and Implementation classes.
* OnBehalfOfCallbackHandler class


====== Web service provider WSDL

The OnBehalfOf web service provider's WSDL is a clone of the
ws-provider's WSDL. The wsp:Policy section is the same. There are
changes to the service endpoint, targetNamespace, portType, binding
name, and service.

====== Web Service Interface

The web service provider interface class, OnBehalfOfServiceIface, is a
simple web service definition.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.onbehalfof;

import jakarta.jws.WebMethod;
import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/onbehalfofwssecuritypolicy"
)
public interface OnBehalfOfServiceIface
{
   @WebMethod
   String sayHello();
}
....


====== Web Service Implementation

The web service provider implementation class, OnBehalfOfServiceImpl, is
a POJO. It uses the standard WebService annotation to define the
service endpoint and two Apache WSS4J annotations, EndpointProperties
and EndpointProperty used for configuring the endpoint for the CXF
runtime. The WSS4J configuration information provided is for WSS4J's
Crypto Merlin implementation.

OnBehalfOfServiceImpl is calling the ServiceImpl acting on behalf of the
user. Method setupService performs the requisite configuration setup.

====== OnBehalfOfCallbackHandler

OnBehalfOfCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto
API. It is used to obtain the password for the private key in the
keystore. This class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user
name to use for the message signature. This class has been revised to
return the passwords for this service, myactaskey and the "OnBehalfOf"
user, alice.

===== Web service requester

This section examines the ws-requester elements from the basic WS-Trust
scenario that have been changed to address the needs of the OnBehalfOf
example. The component is

* OnBehalfOf web service requester implementation class


====== Web service requester Implementation

The OnBehalfOf ws-requester, the client, uses standard procedures for
creating a reference to the web service in the first four lines. To
address the endpoint security requirements, the web service's "Request
Context" is configured via the BindingProvider. Information needed in
the message generation is provided through it. The OnBehalfOf user,
alice, is declared in this section and the callbackHandler,
UsernameTokenCallbackHandler is provided to the STSClient for generation
of the contents for the OnBehalfOf message element. In this example a
STSClient object is created and provided to the proxy's request context.
The alternative is to provide keys tagged with the ".it" suffix as was
done in the Basic Scenario client. The use of OnBehalfOf is configured by the
method call stsClient.setOnBehalfOf. The alternative is to use the key
SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_ON_BEHALF_OF and a value in the props map.

....

proxy.sayHello();
....


==== SAML Bearer Assertion Scenario

WS-Trust deals with managing software security tokens. A SAML assertion
is a type of security token. In the SAML Bearer scenario, the service
provider automatically trusts that the incoming SOAP request came from
the subject defined in the SAML token after the service verifies the
tokens signature.

Implementation of this scenario has the following requirements.

* SAML tokens with a Bearer subject confirmation method must be
protected so the token can not be snooped. In most cases, a bearer token
combined with HTTPS is sufficient to prevent "a man in the middle"
getting possession of the token. This means a security policy that uses
a sp:TransportBinding and sp:HttpsToken.
* A bearer token has no encryption or signing keys associated with it,
therefore a sp:IssuedToken of bearer keyType should be used with a
sp:SupportingToken or a sp:SignedSupportingTokens.


===== Web service Provider

This section examines the web service elements for the SAML Bearer
scenario. The components are

* Bearer web service provider's WSDL
* SSL configuration
* Bearer web service provider's Interface and Implementation classes.
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF


====== Web service provider WSDL

The web service provider is a contract-first endpoint. All the WS-trust
and security policies for it are declared in WSDL, BearerService.wsdl.
For this scenario a ws-requester is required to present a SAML 2.0
Bearer token issued from a designed STS. The address of the STS is
provided in the WSDL. HTTPS, a TransportBinding and HttpsToken policy
are used to protect the SOAP body of messages that pass back and forth
between ws-requester and ws-provider. A detailed explanation of the
security settings are provided in the comments in the listing below.

====== SSL configuration

This web service is using https, therefore the JBoss server must be
configured to provide SSL support in the Web subsystem. There are 2
components to SSL configuration.

* create a certificate keystore
* declare an SSL connector in the Web subsystem of the JBoss server
configuration file.

Follow the directions this section in the
https://docs.wildfly.org/26.1/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html#configure-ssltls[Configure SSL/TLS] .

Here is an example of an SSL connector declaration.

<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.4" default-virtual-server="default-host" native="false">
  .....
  <connector name="jbws-https-connector" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="https" socket-binding="https" secure="true" enabled="true">
    <ssl key-alias="tomcat" password="changeit" certificate-key-file="/myJbossHome/security/test.keystore" verify-client="false"/>
  </connector>
  ...

====== Web service Interface

The web service provider interface class, BearerIface, is a simple
straight forward web service definition.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.bearer;

import jakarta.jws.WebMethod;
import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/bearerwssecuritypolicy"
)
public interface BearerIface
{
   @WebMethod
   String sayHello();
}
....


====== Web service Implementation

The web service provider implementation class, BearerImpl, is a
POJO. It uses the standard WebService annotation to define the service
endpoint. There are two Apache CXF annotations,
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty used for configuring the
endpoint for the CXF runtime. These annotations come from the
https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/[Apache WSS4J project] , which provides a
Java implementation of the primary WS-Security standards for Web
Services. These annotations are programmatically adding properties to
the endpoint. With plain Apache CXF, these properties are often set via
the <jaxws:properties> element on the <jaxws:endpoint> element in the
Spring config; these annotations allow the properties to be configured
in the code.

WSS4J uses the Crypto interface to get keys and certificates for
signature creation/verification, as is asserted by the WSDL for this
service. The WSS4J configuration information being provided by
BearerImpl is for Crypto's Merlin implementation. More information will
be provided about this in the keystore section.

Because the web service provider automatically trusts that the incoming
SOAP request came from the subject defined in the SAML token there is no
need for a Crypto callbackHandler class or a signature username, unlike
in prior examples, however in order to verify the message signature, the
Java properties file that contains the (Merlin) crypto configuration
information is still required.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.bearer;

import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperties;
import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperty;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   portName = "BearerServicePort",
   serviceName = "BearerService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/BearerService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/bearerwssecuritypolicy",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.bearer.BearerIface"
)
@EndpointProperties(value = {
   @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.properties", value = "serviceKeystore.properties")
})
public class BearerImpl implements BearerIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Bearer WS-Trust Hello World!";
   }
}
....


====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File serviceKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=sspass
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias=myservicekey
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=servicestore.jks
....


====== MANIFEST.MF

When deployed on WildFly this application requires access to the JBossWs
and CXF APIs provided in module org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client. The
dependency statement directs the server to provide them at deployment.

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0

===== Bearer Security Token Service

This section examines the crucial elements in providing the Security
Token Service functionality for providing a SAML Bearer token. The
components that will be discussed are.

* Security Domain
* STS's WSDL
* STS's implementation class
* STSBearerCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF


====== Security Domain

The STS requires a JBoss security domain be configured. The
jboss-web.xml descriptor declares a named security
domain,"JBossWS-trust-sts" to be used by this service for
authentication. This security domain requires two properties files and
the addition of a security-domain declaration in the JBoss server
configuration file.

For this scenario the domain needs to contain user _alice_ , password
_clarinet_ , and role _friend_ . See the listings below for
jbossws-users.properties and jbossws-roles.properties. The
following XML must be added to the JBoss security subsystem in the
server configuration file. Replace " *SOME_PATH* " with appropriate
information.

....
<security-domain name="JBossWS-trust-sts">
  <authentication>
    <login-module code="UsersRoles" flag="required">
      <module-option name="usersProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-users.properties"/>
      <module-option name="unauthenticatedIdentity" value="anonymous"/>
      <module-option name="rolesProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-roles.properties"/>
    </login-module>
  </authentication>
</security-domain>
....

jboss-web.xml

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE jboss-web PUBLIC "-//JBoss//DTD Web Application 2.4//EN" ">  
<jboss-web>  
  <security-domain>java:/jaas/JBossWS-trust-sts</security-domain>  
</jboss-web>
....

jbossws-users.properties

....
# A sample users.properties file for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule  
alice=clarinet
....

jbossws-roles.properties

....
# A sample roles.properties file for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule  
alice=friend
....

====== STS's implementation class

The Apache CXF's STS, SecurityTokenServiceProvider, is a web service
provider that is compliant with the protocols and functionality defined
by the WS-Trust specification. It has a modular architecture. Many of
its components are configurable or replaceable and there are many
optional features that are enabled by implementing and configuring
plug-ins. Users can customize their own STS by extending from
SecurityTokenServiceProvider and overriding the default settings.
Extensive information about the CXF's STS configurable and pluggable
components can be found
http://coheigea.blogspot.com/2011/11/apache-cxf-sts-documentation-part-viii_10.html[here]
.

This STS implementation class, SampleSTSBearer, is a POJO that extends
from SecurityTokenServiceProvider. Note that the class is defined with a
WebServiceProvider annotation and not a WebService annotation. This
annotation defines the service as a Provider-based endpoint, meaning it
supports a more messaging-oriented approach to Web services. In
particular, it signals that the exchanged messages will be XML documents
of some type. SecurityTokenServiceProvider is an implementation of the
jakarta.xml.ws.Provider interface. In comparison the WebService annotation
defines a (service endpoint interface) SEI-based endpoint which supports
message exchange via SOAP envelopes.

As was done in the BearerImpl class, the WSS4J annotations
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty are providing endpoint
configuration for the CXF runtime. The first EndpointProperty statement
in the listing is declaring the user's name to use for the message
signature. It is used as the alias name in the keystore to get the
user's cert and private key for signature. The next two EndpointProperty
statements declares the Java properties file that contains the (Merlin)
crypto configuration information. In this case both for signing and
encrypting the messages. WSS4J reads this file and extra required
information for message handling. The last EndpointProperty statement
declares the STSBearerCallbackHandler implementation class. It is used
to obtain the user's password for the certificates in the keystore file.

In this implementation we are customizing the operations of token
issuance, token validation and their static properties.

StaticSTSProperties is used to set select properties for configuring
resources in the STS. You may think this is a duplication of the
settings made with the WSS4J annotations. The values are the same but
the underlying structures being set are different, thus this
information must be declared in both places.

The setIssuer setting is important because it uniquely identifies the
issuing STS. The issuer string is embedded in issued tokens and, when
validating tokens, the STS checks the issuer string value. Consequently,
it is important to use the issuer string in a consistent way, so that
the STS can recognize the tokens that it has issued.

The setEndpoints call allows the declaration of a set of allowed token
recipients by address. The addresses are specified as reg-ex patterns.

TokenIssueOperation has a modular structure. This allows custom
behaviors to be injected into the processing of messages. In this case
we are overriding the SecurityTokenServiceProvider's default behavior
and performing SAML token processing. CXF provides an implementation of
a SAMLTokenProvider which we are using rather than writing our own.

====== STSBearerCallbackHandler

STSBearerCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API.
It is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore.
This class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use
for the message signature.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.stsbearer;

import org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.extensions.security.PasswordCallbackHandler;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

   }

   private static Map<String, String> getInitMap()
   {
      Map<String, String> passwords = new HashMap<String, String>();
      passwords.put("mystskey", "stskpass");
      passwords.put("alice", "clarinet");
      return passwords;
   }
}
....


====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File stsKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

===== Web service requester

This section examines the crucial elements in calling a web service that
implements endpoint security as described in the SAML Bearer scenario.
The components that will be discussed are.

* Web service requester's implementation
* ClientCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files


====== Web service requester Implementation

The ws-requester, the client, uses standard procedures for creating a
reference to the web service. To address the endpoint security
requirements, the web service's "Request Context" is configured with the
information needed in message generation. The STSClient
that communicates with the STS is configured with similar values. Note
the key strings ending with a ".it" suffix. This suffix flags these
settings as belonging to the STSClient. The internal CXF code assigns
this information to the STSClient that is auto-generated for this
service call.

There is an alternate method of setting up the STSCLient. The user may
provide their own instance of the STSClient. The CXF code will use this
object and not auto-generate one. When providing the STSClient in this
way, the user must provide a org.apache.cxf.Bus for it and the
configuration keys must not have the ".it" suffix. This is used in the
ActAs and OnBehalfOf examples.

....
  String serviceURL = "https://" + getServerHost() + ":8443/jaxws-samples-wsse-policy-trust-bearer/BearerService";

  final QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/bearerwssecuritypolicy", "BearerService");
  Service service = Service.create(new URL(serviceURL + "?wsdl"), serviceName);
  BearerIface proxy = (BearerIface) service.getPort(BearerIface.class);

  Map<String, Object> ctx = ((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext();

  // set the security related configuration information for the service "request"
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER, new ClientCallbackHandler());
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_PROPERTIES,
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
    "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES,
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
    "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_USERNAME, "myclientkey");
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME, "myservicekey");

  //-- Configuration settings that will be transfered to the STSClient
  // "alice" is the name provided for the WSS Username. Her password will
  // be retreived from the ClientCallbackHander by the STSClient.
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.USERNAME + ".it", "alice");
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER + ".it", new ClientCallbackHandler());
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES + ".it",
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
    "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME + ".it", "mystskey");
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_USERNAME + ".it", "myclientkey");
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_PROPERTIES + ".it",
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
    "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
  ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_USE_CERT_FOR_KEYINFO + ".it", "true");

  proxy.sayHello();
....


====== ClientCallbackHandler

ClientCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It
is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the username to use for
the message signature. Note that "alice" and her password have been
provided here. This information is not in the (JKS) keystore but
provided in the WildFly security domain. It was declared in file
jbossws-users.properties.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.shared;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback;
import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler;
import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException;
import org.apache.ws.security.WSPasswordCallback;

public class ClientCallbackHandler implements CallbackHandler {

    public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException,
            UnsupportedCallbackException {
        for (int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {
            if (callbacks[i] instanceof WSPasswordCallback) {
                WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback) callbacks[i];
                if ("myclientkey".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("ckpass");
                    break;
                } else if ("alice".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("clarinet");
                    break;
                } else if ("bob".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("trombone");
                    break;
                } else if ("myservicekey".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {  // rls test  added for bearer test
                   pc.setPassword("skpass");
                   break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

==== SAML Holder-Of-Key Assertion Scenario

WS-Trust deals with managing software security tokens. A SAML assertion
is a type of security token. In the Holder-Of-Key method, the STS
creates a SAML token containing the client's public key and signs the
SAML token with its private key. The client includes the SAML token and
signs the outgoing soap envelope to the web service with its private
key. The web service validates the SOAP message and the SAML token.

Implementation of this scenario has the following requirements.

* SAML tokens with a Holder-Of-Key subject confirmation method must be
protected so the token can not be snooped. In most cases, a
Holder-Of-Key token combined with HTTPS is sufficient to prevent "a man
in the middle" getting possession of the token. This means a security
policy that uses a sp:TransportBinding and sp:HttpsToken.
* A Holder-Of-Key token has no encryption or signing keys associated
with it, therefore a sp:IssuedToken of SymmetricKey or PublicKey keyType
should be used with a sp:SignedEndorsingSupportingTokens.


===== Web service Provider

This section examines the web service elements for the SAML
Holder-Of-Key scenario. The components are

* Web service provider's WSDL
* SSL configuration
* Web service provider's Interface and Implementation classes.
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF


====== Web service provider WSDL

The web service provider is a contract-first endpoint. All the WS-trust
and security policies for it are declared in the WSDL,
HolderOfKeyService.wsdl. For this scenario a ws-requester is required to
present a SAML 2.0 token of SymmetricKey keyType, issued from a designed
STS. The address of the STS is provided in the WSDL. A transport binding
policy is used. The token is declared to be signed and endorsed,
sp:SignedEndorsingSupportingTokens. A detailed explanation of the
security settings are provided in the comments in the listing below.

====== SSL configuration
This web service is using https, therefore the JBoss server must be
configured to provide SSL support in the Web subsystem. There are 2
components to SSL configuration.

* create a certificate keystore
* declare an SSL connector in the Web subsystem of the JBoss server
configuration file.

Follow the directions in the section
https://docs.wildfly.org/26.1/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html#configure-ssltls[Configure SSL/TLS] .

Here is an example of an SSL connector declaration.

....
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.4" default-virtual-server="default-host" native="false">
.....
  <connector name="jbws-https-connector" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="https" socket-binding="https" secure="true" enabled="true">
    <ssl key-alias="tomcat" password="changeit" certificate-key-file="/myJbossHome/security/test.keystore" verify-client="false"/>
  </connector>
...
....


====== Web service Interface

The web service provider interface class, HolderOfKeyIface, is a simple
straight forward web service definition.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.holderofkey;

import jakarta.jws.WebMethod;
import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/holderofkeywssecuritypolicy"
)
public interface HolderOfKeyIface {
   @WebMethod
   String sayHello();
}
....


====== Web service Implementation

The web service provider implementation class, HolderOfKeyImpl, is a
POJO. It uses the standard WebService annotation to define the
service endpoint. There are two Apache CXF annotations,
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty used for configuring the
endpoint for the CXF runtime. These annotations come from the
https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/[Apache WSS4J project] , which provides a
Java implementation of the primary WS-Security standards for Web
Services. These annotations are programmatically adding properties to
the endpoint. With plain Apache CXF, these properties are often set via
the <jaxws:properties> element on the <jaxws:endpoint> element in the
Spring config; these annotations allow the properties to be configured
in the code.

WSS4J uses the Crypto interface to get keys and certificates for
signature creation/verification, as is asserted by the WSDL for this
service. The WSS4J configuration information being provided by
HolderOfKeyImpl is for Crypto's Merlin implementation. More information
will be provided about this in the keystore section.

The first EndpointProperty statement in the listing disables ensurance
of compliance with the Basic Security Profile 1.1. The next
EndpointProperty statements declares the Java properties file that
contains the (Merlin) crypto configuration information. The last
EndpointProperty statement declares the STSHolderOfKeyCallbackHandler
implementation class. It is used to obtain the user's password for the
certificates in the keystore file.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.holderofkey;

import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperties;
import org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperty;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
   (
      portName = "HolderOfKeyServicePort",
      serviceName = "HolderOfKeyService",
      wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/HolderOfKeyService.wsdl",
      targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/holderofkeywssecuritypolicy",
      endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.holderofkey.HolderOfKeyIface"
   )
@EndpointProperties(value = {
   @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.is-bsp-compliant", value = "false"),
   @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.signature.properties", value = "serviceKeystore.properties"),
   @EndpointProperty(key = "ws-security.callback-handler", value = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.holderofkey.HolderOfKeyCallbackHandler")
})
public class HolderOfKeyImpl implements HolderOfKeyIface
{
   public String sayHello()
   {
      return "Holder-Of-Key WS-Trust Hello World!";
   }
}
....


====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File serviceKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

....
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider=org.apache.ws.security.components.crypto.Merlin
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.type=jks
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.password=sspass
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias=myservicekey
org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.keystore.file=servicestore.jks
....


====== MANIFEST.MF

When deployed on WildFly this application requires access to the JBossWs
and CXF APIs provided in module org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client. The
dependency statement directs the server to provide them at deployment.

....
Manifest-Version:1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant1.8.2
Created-By:1.7.0_25-b15 (Oracle Corporation)
Dependencies: org.jboss.ws.cxf.jbossws-cxf-client
....


===== Security Token Service

This section examines the crucial elements in providing the Security
Token Service functionality for providing a SAML Holder-Of-Key token.
The components that will be discussed are.

* Security Domain
* STS's WSDL
* STS's implementation class
* STSBearerCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files
* MANIFEST.MF


====== Security Domain

The STS requires a JBoss security domain be configured. The
jboss-web.xml descriptor declares a named security
domain,"JBossWS-trust-sts" to be used by this service for
authentication. This security domain requires two properties files and
the addition of a security-domain declaration in the JBoss server
configuration file.

For this scenario the domain needs to contain user _alice_ , password
_clarinet_ , and role _friend_ . See the listings below for
jbossws-users.properties and jbossws-roles.properties. In addition the
following XML must be added to the JBoss security subsystem in the
server configuration file. Replace " *SOME_PATH* " with appropriate
information.

....
<security-domain name="JBossWS-trust-sts">
  <authentication>
   <login-module code="UsersRoles" flag="required">
     <module-option name="usersProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-users.properties"/>
     <module-option name="unauthenticatedIdentity" value="anonymous"/>
     <module-option name="rolesProperties" value="/SOME_PATH/jbossws-roles.properties"/>
   </login-module>
  </authentication>
</security-domain>
....

====== STS's implementation class

The Apache CXF's STS, SecurityTokenServiceProvider, is a web service
provider that is compliant with the protocols and functionality defined
by the WS-Trust specification. It has a modular architecture. Many of
its components are configurable or replaceable and there are many
optional features that are enabled by implementing and configuring
plug-ins. Users can customize their own STS by extending from
SecurityTokenServiceProvider and overriding the default settings.
Extensive information about the CXF's STS configurable and pluggable
components can be found
http://coheigea.blogspot.com/2011/11/apache-cxf-sts-documentation-part-viii_10.html[here]
.

This STS implementation class, SampleSTSHolderOfKey, is a POJO that
extends from SecurityTokenServiceProvider. Note that the class is
defined with a WebServiceProvider annotation and not a WebService
annotation. This annotation defines the service as a Provider-based
endpoint, meaning it supports a more messaging-oriented approach to Web
services. In particular, it signals that the exchanged messages will be
XML documents of some type. SecurityTokenServiceProvider is an
implementation of the jakarta.xml.ws.Provider interface. In comparison the
WebService annotation defines a (service endpoint interface) SEI-based
endpoint which supports message exchange via SOAP envelopes.

As was done in the HolderOfKeyImpl class, the WSS4J annotations
EndpointProperties and EndpointProperty are providing endpoint
configuration for the CXF runtime. The first EndpointProperty statements
declares the Java properties file that contains the (Merlin) crypto
configuration information. WSS4J reads this file and extra required
information for message handling. The last EndpointProperty statement
declares the STSHolderOfKeyCallbackHandler implementation class. It is
used to obtain the user's password for the certificates in the keystore
file.

In this implementation we are customizing the operations of token
issuance and their static properties.

StaticSTSProperties is used to set select properties for configuring
resources in the STS. You may think this is a duplication of the
settings made with the WSS4J annotations. The values are the same but
the underlying structures being set are different, thus this
information must be declared in both places.

The setIssuer setting is important because it uniquely identifies the
issuing STS. The issuer string is embedded in issued tokens and, when
validating tokens, the STS checks the issuer string value. Consequently,
it is important to use the issuer string in a consistent way, so that
the STS can recognize the tokens that it has issued.

The setEndpoints call allows the declaration of a set of allowed token
recipients by address. The addresses are specified as reg-ex patterns.

TokenIssueOperation has a modular structure. This allows custom
behaviors to be injected into the processing of messages. In this case
we are overriding the SecurityTokenServiceProvider's default behavior
and performing SAML token processing. CXF provides an implementation of
a SAMLTokenProvider which we are using rather than writing our own.

====== HolderOfKeyCallbackHandler

STSHolderOfKeyCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto
API. It is used to obtain the password for the private key in the
keystore. This class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user
name to use for the message signature.

      return passwords;
   }
}
....


====== Crypto properties and keystore files

WSS4J's Crypto implementation is loaded and configured via a Java
properties file that contains Crypto configuration data. The file
contains implementation-specific properties such as a keystore location,
password, default alias and the like. This application is using the
Merlin implementation. File stsKeystore.properties contains this
information.

File servicestore.jks, is a Java KeyStore (JKS) repository. It contains
self signed certificates for myservicekey and mystskey. _Self signed
certificates are not appropriate for production use._

===== Web service requester

This section examines the crucial elements in calling a web service that
implements endpoint security as described in the SAML Holder-Of-Key
scenario. The components that will be discussed are.

* web service requester's implementation
* ClientCallbackHandler
* Crypto properties and keystore files


====== Web service requester Implementation

The ws-requester, the client, uses standard procedures for creating a
reference to the web service. To address the endpoint security
requirements, the web service's "Request Context" is configured with the
information needed in message generation. In addition, the STSClient
that communicates with the STS is configured with similar values. Note
the key strings ending with a ".it" suffix. This suffix flags these
settings as belonging to the STSClient. The internal CXF code assigns
this information to the STSClient that is auto-generated for this
service call.

There is an alternate method of setting up the STSCLient. The user may
provide their own instance of the STSClient. The CXF code will use this
object and not auto-generate one. When providing the STSClient in this
way, the user must provide a org.apache.cxf.Bus for it and the
configuration keys must not have the ".it" suffix. This is used in the
ActAs and OnBehalfOf examples.

....
String serviceURL = "https://" + getServerHost() + ":8443/jaxws-samples-wsse-policy-trust-holderofkey/HolderOfKeyService";

final QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/holderofkeywssecuritypolicy", "HolderOfKeyService");
final URL wsdlURL = new URL(serviceURL + "?wsdl");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
HolderOfKeyIface proxy = (HolderOfKeyIface) service.getPort(HolderOfKeyIface.class);

Map<String, Object> ctx = ((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext();

// set the security related configuration information for the service "request"
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER, new ClientCallbackHandler());
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_PROPERTIES,
  Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
  "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES,
  Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(
  "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.SIGNATURE_USERNAME, "myclientkey");
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_USERNAME, "myservicekey");

//-- Configuration settings that will be transfered to the STSClient
// "alice" is the name provided for the WSS Username. Her password will
// be retreived from the ClientCallbackHander by the STSClient.
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.USERNAME + ".it", "alice");
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.CALLBACK_HANDLER + ".it", new ClientCallbackHandler());
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.ENCRYPT_PROPERTIES + ".it",
  Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(

  "META-INF/clientKeystore.properties"));
ctx.put(SecurityConstants.STS_TOKEN_USE_CERT_FOR_KEYINFO + ".it", "true");

proxy.sayHello();
....


====== ClientCallbackHandler

ClientCallbackHandler is a callback handler for the WSS4J Crypto API. It
is used to obtain the password for the private key in the keystore. This
class enables CXF to retrieve the password of the user name to use for
the message signature. Note that "alice" and her password have been
provided here. This information is not in the (JKS) keystore but
provided in the WildFly security domain. It was declared in file
jbossws-users.properties.

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsse.policy.trust.shared;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback;
import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler;
import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException;
import org.apache.ws.security.WSPasswordCallback;

public class ClientCallbackHandler implements CallbackHandler {

    public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) throws IOException,
            UnsupportedCallbackException {
        for (int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {
            if (callbacks[i] instanceof WSPasswordCallback) {
                WSPasswordCallback pc = (WSPasswordCallback) callbacks[i];
                if ("myclientkey".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("ckpass");
                    break;
                } else if ("alice".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("clarinet");
                    break;
                } else if ("bob".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {
                    pc.setPassword("trombone");
                    break;
                } else if ("myservicekey".equals(pc.getIdentifier())) {  // rls test  added for bearer test
                   pc.setPassword("skpass");
                   break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

=== WS-Reliable Messaging

JBoss Web Services inherits full WS-Reliable Messaging capabilities from
the underlying Apache CXF implementation. At the time of writing, Apache
CXF provides support for the
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/[WS-Reliable Messaging 1.0]
(February 2005) version of the specification.


==== Enabling WS-Reliable Messaging

WS-Reliable Messaging is implemented internally in Apache CXF through a
set of interceptors that deal with the low level requirements of the
reliable messaging protocol. In order for enabling WS-Reliable
Messaging, users need to either:

* consume a WSDL contract that specifies proper WS-Reliable Messaging
policies / assertions
* manually add / configure the reliable messaging interceptors
* specify the reliable messaging policies in an optional CXF Spring XML
descriptor
* specify the Apache CXF reliable messaging feature in an optional CXF
Spring XML descriptor

The former approach relies on the Apache CXF WS-Policy engine and is the
only portable one. The other approaches are Apache CXF proprietary ones,
however they allow for fine-grained configuration of protocol aspects
that are not covered by the WS-Reliable Messaging Policy. More details
are available in the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsrmconfiguration.html[Apache CXF
documentation] .


==== Example

In this example we configure WS-Reliable Messaging endpoint and client
through the WS-Policy support.


===== Endpoint

We go with a contract-first approach, so we start by creating a proper
WSDL contract, containing the WS-Reliable Messaging and WS-Addressing
policies (the latter is a requirement of the former):

....

Then we use the _wsconsume_ tool to generate both standard JAX-WS client
and endpoint.

We provide a basic JAX-WS implementation for the endpoint, nothing
special in it:

   name = "SimpleService",
   serviceName = "SimpleService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/SimpleService.wsdl",
   targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wsrm"
)
public class SimpleServiceImpl
{
   @Oneway
   @WebMethod
   public void ping()
   {
      System.out.println("ping()");
   }

   @WebMethod
   public String echo(String s)
   {
      System.out.println("echo(" + s + ")");
      return s;
   }
}
....

Finally we package the generated POJO endpoint together with a basic
web.xml the usual way and deploy to the application server. The
webservices stack automatically detects the policies and enables
WS-Reliable Messaging.


===== Client

The endpoint advertises his RM capabilities (and requirements) through
the published WSDL and the client is required to also enable WS-RM for
successfully exchanging messages with the server.

A regular JAX-WS client is enough if the user does not need to tune
any specific detail of the RM subsystem.

....
QName serviceName = new QName("http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/ws-extensions/wsrm", "SimpleService");
URL wsdlURL = new URL("http://localhost:8080/jaxws-samples-wsrm-api?wsdl");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
proxy = (SimpleService)service.getPort(SimpleService.class);
proxy.echo("Hello World!");
....


===== Additional configuration

Fine-grained tuning of WS-Reliable Messaging engine requires setting up
proper RM features and attach them for instance to the client proxy.
Here is an example:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsrm.client;

//...
import jakarta.xml.ws.Service;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.feature.RMFeature;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.manager.AcksPolicyType;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.manager.DestinationPolicyType;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rmp.v200502.RMAssertion;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rmp.v200502.RMAssertion.AcknowledgementInterval;
import org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsrm.generated.SimpleService;

//...
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);

RMFeature feature = new RMFeature();
RMAssertion rma = new RMAssertion();
RMAssertion.BaseRetransmissionInterval bri = new RMAssertion.BaseRetransmissionInterval();
bri.setMilliseconds(4000L);
rma.setBaseRetransmissionInterval(bri);
AcknowledgementInterval ai = new AcknowledgementInterval();
ai.setMilliseconds(2000L);
rma.setAcknowledgementInterval(ai);
feature.setRMAssertion(rma);
DestinationPolicyType dp = new DestinationPolicyType();
AcksPolicyType ap = new AcksPolicyType();
ap.setIntraMessageThreshold(0);
dp.setAcksPolicy(ap);
feature.setDestinationPolicy(dp);

SimpleService proxy = (SimpleService)service.getPort(SimpleService.class, feature);
proxy.echo("Hello World");
....

The same can of course be achieved by factoring the feature into a
custom pojo extending `org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.feature.RMFeature` and
setting the obtained property in a client configuration:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsrm.client;

import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.feature.RMFeature;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.manager.AcksPolicyType;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.manager.DestinationPolicyType;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rmp.v200502.RMAssertion;
import org.apache.cxf.ws.rmp.v200502.RMAssertion.AcknowledgementInterval;

public class CustomRMFeature extends RMFeature
{
   public CustomRMFeature() {
      super();
      RMAssertion rma = new RMAssertion();
      RMAssertion.BaseRetransmissionInterval bri = new RMAssertion.BaseRetransmissionInterval();
      bri.setMilliseconds(4000L);
      rma.setBaseRetransmissionInterval(bri);
      AcknowledgementInterval ai = new AcknowledgementInterval();
      ai.setMilliseconds(2000L);
      rma.setAcknowledgementInterval(ai);
      super.setRMAssertion(rma);
      DestinationPolicyType dp = new DestinationPolicyType();
      AcksPolicyType ap = new AcksPolicyType();
      ap.setIntraMessageThreshold(0);
      dp.setAcksPolicy(ap);
      super.setDestinationPolicy(dp);
   }
}
....

... this is how the `jaxws-client-config.xml` descriptor would look:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<jaxws-config xmlns="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:jakartaee="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
  xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:jbossws-jaxws-config:5.0 schema/jbossws-jaxws-config_5_0.xsd">

  <client-config>
    <config-name>Custom Client Config</config-name>
    <property>
      <property-name>cxf.features</property-name>
      <property-value>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.wsrm.client.CustomRMFeature</property-value>
    </property>
  </client-config>

</jaxws-config>
....

... and this is how the client would set the configuration:

....
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigUtil;
import org.jboss.ws.api.configuration.ClientConfigurer;

//...
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
SimpleService proxy = (SimpleService)service.getPort(SimpleService.class);

ClientConfigurer configurer = ClientConfigUtil.resolveClientConfigurer();
configurer.setConfigProperties(proxy, "META-INF/jaxws-client-config.xml", "Custom Client Config");
proxy.echo("Hello World!");
....


=== SOAP over JMS

JBoss Web Services allows communication over the _JMS_ transport. The
functionality comes from Apache CXF support for the
http://www.w3.org/TR/soapjms/[SOAP over Java Message Service 1.0]
specification, which is aimed at a set of standards for interoperable
transport of _SOAP_ messages over _JMS_ .

On top of Apache CXF functionalities, the JBossWS integration allows
users to deploy WS archives containing both _JMS_ and _HTTP_ endpoints
the same way as they do for basic _HTTP_ WS endpoints (in _war_
archives). The webservices layer of WildFly takes care of looking for
_JMS_ enpdoints in the deployed archive and starts them delegating to
the Apache CXF core similarly as with _HTTP_ endpoints.


==== Configuring SOAP over JMS

As per specification, the _SOAP over JMS_ transport configuration is
controlled by proper elements and attributes in the `binding` and
`service` elements of the WSDL contract. A _JMS_ endpoint is usually
developed using a contract-first approach.

The https://cxf.apache.org/docs/soap-over-jms-10-support.html[Apache CXF
documentation] covers all the details of the supported configurations.
The minimum configuration implies:

* setting a proper JMS URI in the `soap:address` `location` [1]
* providing a JNDI connection factory name to be used for connecting to
the queues [2]
* setting the transport binding [3]

....
<wsdl:definitions name="HelloWorldService" targetNamespace="http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms"

    <soap:address location="jms:queue:testQueue"/> <!-- 1 -->
  </wsdl:port>
</wsdl:service>
....

Apache CXF takes care of setting up the JMS transport for endpoint
implementations whose `@WebService` annotation points to a port declared
for JMS transport as explained above.

[NOTE]
====
JBossWS currently supports POJO endpoints only for JMS transport use.
The endpoint classes can be deployed as part of _jar_ or _war_ archives.

The _web.xml_ descriptor in _war_ archives doesn't need any entry for
JMS endpoints.
====


==== Examples


===== JMS endpoint only deployment

In this example we create a simple endpoint relying on _SOAP over JMS_
and deploy it as part of a jar archive.

The endpoint is created using wsconsume tool from a WSDL contract such
as:

....
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<wsdl:definitions name="HelloWorldService" targetNamespace="http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms"

      <wsdl:input name="echo">

      </wsdl:input>
      <wsdl:output name="echoResponse">

    </wsdl:operation>
  </wsdl:binding>
  <wsdl:service name="HelloWorldService">
    <soapjms:jndiConnectionFactoryName>java:jms/RemoteConnectionFactory</soapjms:jndiConnectionFactoryName>
    <soapjms:jndiInitialContextFactory>org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory</soapjms:jndiInitialContextFactory>
    <soapjms:jndiURL>http-remoting://myhost:8080</soapjms:jndiURL>
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:HelloWorldServiceSoapBinding" name="HelloWorldImplPort">
      <soap:address location="jms:queue:testQueue"/>
    </wsdl:port>
  </wsdl:service>
  <wsdl:service name="HelloWorldServiceLocal">
    <soapjms:jndiConnectionFactoryName>java:/ConnectionFactory</soapjms:jndiConnectionFactoryName>
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:HelloWorldServiceSoapBinding" name="HelloWorldImplPort">
      <soap:address location="jms:queue:testQueue"/>
    </wsdl:port>
  </wsdl:service>
</wsdl:definitions>
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
The _HelloWorldImplPort_ here is meant for using the _testQueue_ that
has to be created before deploying the endpoint.
====

At the time of writing, _java:/ConnectionFactory_ is the default
connection factory JNDI location.

For allowing remote JNDI lookup of the connection factory, a specific
service ( `HelloWorldService` ) for remote clients is added to the WSDL.
The _java:jms/RemoteConnectionFactory_ is the JNDI location of the same
connection factory mentioned above, except it's exposed for remote
lookup. The `soapjms:jndiInitialContextFactory` and `soap:jmsjndiURL`
complete the remote connection configuration: they depends on the actual
WildFly container the service is running on and specify the the initial
context factory class to use and the JNDI registry address.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Look at the application server domain to see the
configured connection factory JNDI locations.
====

The endpoint implementation is a JAX-WS POJO using @WebService
annotation to refer to the consumed contract:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   portName = "HelloWorldImplPort",
   serviceName = "HelloWorldServiceLocal",
   wsdlLocation = "META-INF/wsdl/HelloWorldService.wsdl",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms.HelloWorld",
   targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms"
)
public class HelloWorldImpl implements HelloWorld
{
   public String echo(String input)
   {
      return input;
   }
}
....

[NOTE]
====
The endpoint implementation references the `HelloWorldServiceLocal` wsdl
service, so that the local JNDI connection factory location is used for
starting the endpoint on server side.
====

The final step is to package the generated service
endpoint interface, the endpoint implementation and the WSDL file in a
_jar_ archive and deploy it:

....
alessio@inuyasha /dati/jbossws/stack/cxf/trunk $ jar -tvf ./modules/testsuite/cxf-tests/target/test-libs/jaxws-cxf-jms-only-deployment.jar

....

[NOTE]
====
A dependency on `org.apache.activemq.artemis` module needs to be added
in MANIFEST.MF when deploying to WildFly.

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0

Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.7.1

Created-By: 17.0-b16 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

Dependencies: org.apache.activemq.artemis
....
====

A JAX-WS client can interact with the JMS endpoint the usual way:

....
URL wsdlUrl = ...
//start another bus to avoid affecting the one that could already be assigned to the current thread - optional but highly suggested
Bus bus = BusFactory.newInstance().createBus();
BusFactory.setThreadDefaultBus(bus);
try
{
   QName serviceName = new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms", "HelloWorldService");
   Service service = Service.create(wsdlUrl, serviceName);
   HelloWorld proxy = (HelloWorld) service.getPort(new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms", "HelloWorldImplPort"), HelloWorld.class);
   setupProxy(proxy);
   proxy.echo("Hi");
}
finally
{
   bus.shutdown(true);
}
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
The WSDL location URL needs to be retrieved in a custom way, depending
on the client application. Given the endpoint is JMS only, there's no
automatically published WSDL contract.
====

In order for performing the remote invocation (which internally goes
through remote JNDI lookup of the connection factory), the calling user
credentials need to be set into the Apache CXF JMSConduit:

....
private void setupProxy(HelloWorld proxy) {
   JMSConfiguration config = conduit.getJmsConfig();
   config.setUserName(JBossWSTestHelper.getTestUsername());
   config.setPassword(JBossWSTestHelper.getTestPassword());
   Properties props = conduit.getJmsConfig().getJndiEnvironment();
   props.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, JBossWSTestHelper.getTestUsername());
   props.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, JBossWSTestHelper.getTestPassword());
}
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Look at the WildFly domain and messaging configuration to see the security requirements. At the time of writing, a
user with `guest` role is required and that's internally checked using
the `other` security domain.
====

Once the endpoint is exposed over JMS transport, any plain JMS
client can also be used to send messages to the webservice endpoint.
Look at the SOAP over JMS spec details and code the client
similarly to

....
Properties env = new Properties();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory");
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "http-remoting://myhost:8080");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, "user");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, "password");
InitialContext context = new InitialContext(env);
QueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (QueueConnectionFactory)context.lookup("jms/RemoteConnectionFactory");
Queue reqQueue = (Queue)context.lookup("jms/queue/test");
Queue resQueue = (Queue)context.lookup("jms/queue/test");
QueueConnection con = connectionFactory.createQueueConnection("user", "password");
QueueSession session = con.createQueueSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
QueueReceiver receiver = session.createReceiver(resQueue);
ResponseListener responseListener = new ResponseListener(); //a custom response listener...
receiver.setMessageListener(responseListener);
con.start();
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(reqMessage);
message.setJMSReplyTo(resQueue);

//setup SOAP-over-JMS properties...
message.setStringProperty("SOAPJMS_contentType", "text/xml");
message.setStringProperty("SOAPJMS_requestURI", "jms:queue:testQueue");

QueueSender sender = session.createSender(reqQueue);
sender.send(message);
sender.close();

...
....


===== JMS and HTTP endpoints deployment

In this example we create a deployment containing an endpoint that
serves over both HTTP and JMS transports.

We from a WSDL contract such as below (please note we've two `binding` /
`portType` for the same `service` ):

....
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

      <soap:address location="jms:queue:testQueue"/>
    </wsdl:port>
</wsdl:definitions>
....

The same considerations of the previous example regarding the JMS queue
and JNDI connection factory still apply. Here we can implement the
endpoint in multiple ways, either with a common implementation class
that's extended by the JMS and HTTP ones, or keep the two implementation
classes independent and just have them implement the same service
endpoint interface:

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms_http;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   portName = "HelloWorldImplPort",
   serviceName = "HelloWorldServiceLocal",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/HelloWorldService.wsdl",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms_http.HelloWorld",
   targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms"
)
public class HelloWorldImpl implements HelloWorld
{
   public String echo(String input)
   {
      System.out.println("input: " + input);
      return input;
   }
}
....

....
package org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms_http;

import jakarta.jws.WebService;

@WebService
(
   portName = "HttpHelloWorldImplPort",
   serviceName = "HelloWorldService",
   wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/HelloWorldService.wsdl",
   endpointInterface = "org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms_http.HelloWorld",
   targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms"
)
public class HttpHelloWorldImpl implements HelloWorld
{
   public String echo(String input)
   {
      System.out.println("input (http): " + input);
      return "(http) " + input;
   }
}
....

Both classes are packaged together the service endpoint interface and
the WSDL file in a _war_ archive:

....

A web.xml descriptor is included to trigger the HTTP
endpoint publish:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd"
  version="2.4">
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>EndpointServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.cxf.jms_http.HttpHelloWorldImpl</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>EndpointServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
The MANIFEST.MF needs to declare a dependency on
_org.apache.activemq.artemis_ module when deploying to WildFly.
====

Finally, the JAX-WS client can interact with both JMS and HTTP endpoints
as usual:

....
//start another bus to avoid affecting the one that could already be assigned to current thread - optional but highly suggested
Bus bus = BusFactory.newInstance().createBus();
BusFactory.setThreadDefaultBus(bus);
try
{
   QName serviceName = new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms", "HelloWorldService");
   Service service = Service.create(wsdlUrl, serviceName);

   //JMS test
   HelloWorld proxy = (HelloWorld) service.getPort(new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms", "HelloWorldImplPort"), HelloWorld.class);
   setupProxy(proxy);
   proxy.echo("Hi");
   //HTTP test
   HelloWorld httpProxy = (HelloWorld) service.getPort(new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/jms", "HttpHelloWorldImplPort"), HelloWorld.class);
   httpProxy.echo("Hi");
}
finally
{
   bus.shutdown(true);
}
....


===== Use of Endpoint.publish() API

An alternative to deploying an archive containing JMS endpoints is
starting them directly using the JAX-WS `Endpoint.publish(..)` API.

It is as easy as doing:

....
Object implementor = new HelloWorldImpl();
Endpoint ep = Endpoint.publish("jms:queue:testQueue", implementor);
try
{
   //use or let others use the endpoint
}
finally
{
   ep.stop();
}
....

where `HelloWorldImpl` is a POJO endpoint implementation referencing a
JMS _port_ in a given WSDL contract, as explained in the previous
examples.

The main difference among the deployment approach is in the direct
control and responsibility over the endpoint lifecycle ( _start/publish_
and _stop_ ).


=== HTTP Proxy

The HTTP Proxy related functionalities of JBoss Web Services are
provided by the Apache CXF http transport layer.

The suggested configuration mechanism when running JBoss Web Services is
explained below; for further information please refer to the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/client-http-transport-including-ssl-support.html[Apache
CXF documentation] .


==== Configuration

The HTTP proxy configuration for a given JAX-WS client can be set in the
following ways:

* through the `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort` system properties,
or
* leveraging the `org.apache.cxf.transport.http.HTTPConduit` options

The former is a JVM level configuration; for instance, assuming the http
proxy is currently running at http://localhost:9934 , here is the
setup:

....
System.getProperties().setProperty("http.proxyHost", "localhost");
System.getProperties().setProperty("http.proxyPort", 9934);
....

The latter is a client stub/port level configuration: the setup is
performed on the `HTTPConduit` object that's part of the Apache CXF
`Client` abstraction.

....
import org.apache.cxf.configuration.security.ProxyAuthorizationPolicy;
import org.apache.cxf.endpoint.Client;
import org.apache.cxf.frontend.ClientProxy;
import org.apache.cxf.transport.http.HTTPConduit;
import org.apache.cxf.transports.http.configuration.HTTPClientPolicy;
import org.apache.cxf.transports.http.configuration.ProxyServerType;
...

Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/httpproxy", "HelloWorldService"));
HelloWorld port = (HelloWorld) service.getPort(new QName("http://org.jboss.ws/jaxws/cxf/httpproxy", "HelloWorldImplPort"), HelloWorld.class);

Client client = ClientProxy.getClient(port);
HTTPConduit conduit = (HTTPConduit)client.getConduit();
ProxyAuthorizationPolicy policy = new ProxyAuthorizationPolicy();
policy.setAuthorizationType("Basic");
policy.setUserName(PROXY_USER);
policy.setPassword(PROXY_PWD);
conduit.setProxyAuthorization(policy);

port.echo("Foo");
....

The `ProxyAuthorizationPolicy` also allows for setting the authotization
type as well as the username / password to be used.

Speaking of authorization and authentication, please note that the JDK
already features the `java.net.Authenticator` facility, which is used
whenever opening a connection to a given URL requiring a http proxy.
Users might want to set a custom Authenticator for instance when needing
to read WSDL contracts before actually calling into the JBoss Web
Services / Apache CXF code; here is an example:

....
import java.net.Authenticator;
import java.net.PasswordAuthentication;
...
public class ProxyAuthenticator extends Authenticator
{
   private String user, password;

   public ProxyAuthenticator(String user, String password)
   {
      this.user = user;
      this.password = password;
   }

   protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication()
   {
      return new PasswordAuthentication(user, password.toCharArray());
   }
}

...

Authenticator.setDefault(new ProxyAuthenticator(PROXY_USER, PROXY_PWD));
....


=== WS-Discovery

Apache CXF includes support for _Web Services Dynamic Discovery_ (
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/discovery/1.1/os/wsdd-discovery-1.1-spec-os.html[WS-Discovery]
), which is a protocol to enable dynamic discovery of services available
on the local network. The protocol implies using a `UDP` based multicast
transport to announce new services and probe for existing services. A
managed mode where a discovery proxy is used to reduce the amount of
required multicast traffic is also covered by the protocol.

JBossWS integrates the _WS-Discovery_
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-discovery.html[functionalities] provided
by Apache CXF into the application server.


==== Enabling WS-Discovery

Apache CXF enables _WS-Discovery_ depending on the availability of its
runtime component; given that's always shipped in the application
server, JBossWS integration requires using the
`cxf.ws-discovery.enabled`
usage for enabling _WS-Discovery_ for a given deployment. By default
_WS-Discovery_ is disabled on the application server. Below is an
example of _jboss-webservices.xml_ descriptor to be used for enabling
_WS-Discovery_ :

....
<webservices xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  version="1.3" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee">

  <property>
    <name>cxf.ws-discovery.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>

</webservices>
....

By default, a _WS-Discovery_ service endpoint (SOAP-over-UDP bound) will
be started the first time a WS-Discovery enabled deployment is processed
on the application server. Every ws endpoint belonging to _WS-Discovery_
enabled deployments will be automatically registered into such a
_WS-Discovery_ service endpoint ( `Hello` messages). The service will
reply to `Probe` and `Resolve` messages received on `UDP` port `3702`
(including multicast messages sent to `IPv4` address `239.255.255.250` ,
as per
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/discovery/1.1/os/wsdd-discovery-1.1-spec-os.html#_Toc234231816[specification]
). Endpoints will eventually be automatically unregistered using `Bye`
messages upon undeployment.


==== Probing services

Apache CXF comes with a _WS-Discovery_ API that can be used to probe /
resolve services. When running in-container, a <<JBoss Modules>> dependency to the the `org.apache.cxf.impl` module is
to be set to have access to _WS-Discovery_ client functionalities.

The
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/cxf/tags/cxf-2.7.5/services/ws-discovery/ws-discovery-api/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/ws/discovery/WSDiscoveryClient.java?revision=1481139&view=markup[org.apache.cxf.ws.discovery.WSDiscoveryClient]
class provides the _probe_ and _resolve_ methods which also accepts
filters on scopes. Users can rely on them for locating available
endpoints on the network. Please have a look at the JBossWS testsuite
which includes a
http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossws/stack/cxf/tags/jbossws-cxf-4.2.0.Beta1/modules/testsuite/cxf-tests/src/test/java/org/jboss/test/ws/jaxws/samples/wsdd/WSDiscoveryTestCase.java[sample]
on CXF WS-Discovery usage.


=== WS-Policy


==== Apache CXF WS-Policy support

JBossWS policy support rely on the Apache CXF WS-Policy framework, which
is compliant with the
http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-ws-policy-20070904/[Web Services Policy
1.5 - Framework] and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-ws-policy-attach-20070904/[Web Services
Policy 1.5 - Attachment] specifications. Users can work with policies in
different ways:

* by adding policy assertions to wsdl contracts and letting the runtime
consume them and behave accordingly;
* by specifying endpoint policy attachments using either CXF annotations
or features.

Of course users can also make direct use of the Apache CXF policy
framework,
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-assertions.html[defining custom
assertions] , etc.

Finally, JBossWS provides some additional annotations for simplified
policy attachment.


===== Contract-first approach

WS-Policies can be attached and referenced in wsdl elements (the
specifications describe all possible alternatives). Apache CXF
automatically recognizes, reads and uses policies defined in the wsdl.

Users should hence develop endpoints using the _contract-first_
approach, that is explicitly providing the contract for their services.
Here is a excerpt taken from a wsdl including a WS-Addressing policy:

....
<wsdl:definitions name="Foo" targetNamespace="http://ws.jboss.org/foo"
...
<wsdl:service name="FooService">
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:FooBinding" name="FooPort">
        <soap:address location="http://localhost:80800/foo"/>
        <wsp:Policy xmlns:wsp="http://www.w3.org/ns/ws-policy">
             <wsam:Addressing xmlns:wsam="http://www.w3.org/2007/02/addressing/metadata">
                 <wsp:Policy/>
              </wsam:Addressing>
         </wsp:Policy>
    </wsdl:port>
</wsdl:service>
</wsdl:definitions>
....

Of course, CXF also acts upon policies specified in wsdl documents
consumed on client side.


===== Code-first approach

For those preferring code-first (java-first) endpoint development,
Apache CXF comes with `org.apache.cxf.annotations.Policy` and
`org.apache.cxf.annotations.Policies` annotations to be used for
attaching policy fragments to the wsdl generated at deploy time.

Here is an example of a code-first endpoint including @Policy
annotation:

....
import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.apache.cxf.annotations.Policy;

@WebService(portName = "MyServicePort",
            serviceName = "MyService",
            name = "MyServiceIface",
            targetNamespace = "http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/foo")
@Policy(placement = Policy.Placement.BINDING, uri = "JavaFirstPolicy.xml")
public class MyServiceImpl {
   public String sayHello() {
      return "Hello World!";
   }
}
....

The referenced descriptor is to be added to the deployment and will
include the policy to be attached; the attachment position in the
contracts is defined through the `placement` attribute. Here is a
descriptor example:

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<wsp:Policy wsu:Id="MyPolicy" xmlns:wsp="http://www.w3.org/ns/ws-policy"
    xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd">
    <wsp:ExactlyOne>
        <wsp:All>
            <sp:SupportingTokens xmlns:sp="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy">
                <wsp:Policy>
                    <sp:UsernameToken sp:IncludeToken="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient">
                        <wsp:Policy>
                            <sp:WssUsernameToken10/>
                        </wsp:Policy>
                    </sp:UsernameToken>
                </wsp:Policy>
            </sp:SupportingTokens>
        </wsp:All>
    </wsp:ExactlyOne>
</wsp:Policy>
....


==== JBossWS additions


===== Policy sets

Both approaches above require users to actually write their policies'
assertions; while this offer great flexibility and control of the actual
contract, providing the assertions might end up being quite a
challenging task for complex policies. For this reason, the JBossWS
integration provides _policy sets_ , which are basically pre-defined
groups of policy assertions corresponding to well known / common needs.
Each set has a label allowing users to specify it in the
`@org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.PolicySets` annotation to have the policy
assertions for that set attached to the annotated endpoint. Multiple
labels can also be specified. Here is an example of the @PolicySets
annotation on a service endpoint interface:

....
import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import org.jboss.ws.api.annotation.PolicySets;

@WebService(name = "EndpointTwo", targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws.jaxws.cxf/jbws3648")
@PolicySets({"WS-RM_Policy_spec_example", "WS-SP-EX223_WSS11_Anonymous_X509_Sign_Encrypt", "WS-Addressing"})
public interface EndpointTwo
{
   String echo(String input);
}
....

The three sets specified in @PolicySets will cause the wsdl generated
for the endpoint having this interface to be enriched with some policy
assertions for WS-RM, WS-Security and WS-Addressing.

The labels' list of known sets is stored in the
`META-INF/policies/org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.extensions.policy.PolicyAttachmentStore`
file within the `jbossws-cxf-client.jar` (
`org.jboss.ws.cxf:jbossws-cxf-client` maven artifact). Actual policy
fragments for each set are also stored in the same artifact at
`META-INF/policies/<set-label>-<attachment-position>.xml` .

Here is a list of the available policy sets:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===

|===

[WARNING]
====
Always verify the contents of the generated wsdl contract, as policy
sets are potentially subject to updates between JBossWS releases. This
is especially important when dealing with security related policies; the
provided sets are to be considered as convenient configuration options
only; users remain responsible for the policies in their contracts.
====

[TIP]
====
The `org.jboss.wsf.stack.cxf.extensions.policy.Constants` interface has
convenient String constants for the available policy set labels.
====

[TIP]
====
If you feel a new set should be added, just propose it by writing the
user forum!

=== Published WSDL customization


==== Endpoint address rewrite

JBossWS supports the rewrite of the `<soap:address>` element of
endpoints published in WSDL contracts. This feature is useful for
controlling the server address that is advertised to clients for each
endpoint. The rewrite mechanism is configured at server level through a
set of elements in the webservices subsystem of the WildFly management
model. Please refer to the container documentation for details on the
options supported in the selected container version. Below is a list of
the elements available in the latest WildFly sources:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|modify-wsdl-address |boolean |This boolean enables and disables the
address rewrite functionality. When modify-wsdl-address is set to true
and the content of <soap:address> is a valid URL, JBossWS will rewrite
the URL using the values of wsdl-host and wsdl-port or wsdl-secure-port.
When modify-wsdl-address is set to false and the content of
<soap:address> is a valid URL, JBossWS will not rewrite the URL. The
<soap:address> URL will be used. When the content of <soap:address> is
not a valid URL, JBossWS will rewrite it no matter what the setting of
modify-wsdl-address. If modify-wsdl-address is set to true and wsdl-host
is not defined or explicitly set to _'_ `jbossws.undefined.host` _' _
the content of <soap:address> URL is use. JBossWS uses the requester's
host when rewriting the <soap:address> When modify-wsdl-address is not
defined JBossWS uses a default value of true.

|wsdl-host |string |The hostname / IP address to be used for rewriting
`<soap:address>` . If `wsdl-host` is set to `jbossws.undefined.host` ,
JBossWS uses the requester's host when rewriting the `<soap:address>`
When wsdl-host is not defined JBossWS uses a default value of '
`jbossws.undefined.host` '.

|wsdl-port |int |Set this property to explicitly define the HTTP port
that will be used for rewriting the SOAP address. Otherwise the HTTP
port will be identified by querying the list of installed HTTP
connectors.

|wsdl-secure-port |int |Set this property to explicitly define the HTTPS
port that will be used for rewriting the SOAP address. Otherwise the
HTTPS port will be identified by querying the list of installed HTTPS
connectors.

|wsdl-uri-scheme |string |This property explicitly sets the URI scheme
to use for rewriting `<soap:address>` . Valid values are `http` and
`https` . This configuration overrides scheme computed by processing the
endpoint (even if a transport guarantee is specified). The provided
values for `wsdl-port` and `wsdl-secure-port` (or their default values)
are used depending on specified scheme.

|wsdl-path-rewrite-rule |string |This string defines a SED substitution
command (e.g., 's/regexp/replacement/g') that JBossWS executes against
the path component of each <soap:address> URL published from the server.
When wsdl-path-rewrite-rule is not defined, JBossWS retains the original
path component of each <soap:address> URL. When 'modify-wsdl-address' is
set to "false" this element is ignored.
|===

Additionally, users can override the server level configuration by
requesting a specific rewrite behavior for a given endpoint deployment.
That is achieved by setting one of the following properties within a
_jboss-webservices.xml_ descriptor:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Corresponding server option
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.modify-wsdl-address |modify-wsdl-address
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-host |wsdl-host
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-port |wsdl-port
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-secure-port |wsdl-secure-port
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-path-rewrite-rule |wsdl-path-rewrite-rule
|wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-uri-scheme |wsdl-uri-scheme
|===

Here is an example of partial overriding of the default configuration
for a specific deployment:

....
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<webservices version="1.2"
  xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee">
  <property>
    <name>wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-uri-scheme</name>
    <value>https</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>wsdl.soapAddress.rewrite.wsdl-host</name>
    <value>foo</value>
  </property>
</webservices>
....


==== System property references

System property references wrapped within "@" characters are expanded
when found in WSDL attribute and element values. This allows for
instance including multiple WS-Policy declarations in the contract and
selecting the policy to use depending on a server wide system property;
here is an example:

....
<wsdl:definitions ...>
  ...
  <wsdl:binding name="ServiceOneSoapBinding" type="tns:EndpointOne">
    ...
    <wsp:PolicyReference URI="#@org.jboss.wsf.test.JBWS3628TestCase.policy@"/>
    <wsdl:operation name="echo">
      ...
    </wsdl:operation>
  </wsdl:binding>
  <wsdl:service name="ServiceOne">
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:ServiceOneSoapBinding" name="EndpointOnePort">
      <soap:address location="http://localhost:8080/jaxws-cxf-jbws3628/ServiceOne"/>
    </wsdl:port>
  </wsdl:service>

  <wsp:Policy xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd" xmlns:wsp="http://www.w3.org/ns/ws-policy" wsu:Id="WS-RM_Policy">
    <wsrmp:RMAssertion xmlns:wsrmp="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/policy">
          ...
    </wsrmp:RMAssertion>
  </wsp:Policy>

  <wsp:Policy xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd" xmlns:wsp="http://www.w3.org/ns/ws-policy"
      xmlns:wsam="http://www.w3.org/2007/05/addressing/metadata" wsu:Id="WS-Addressing_policy">
    <wsam:Addressing>
      <wsp:Policy/>
    </wsam:Addressing>
  </wsp:Policy>
</wsdl:definitions>
....

If the *_org.jboss.wsf.test.JBWS3628TestCase.policy_* system property is
defined and set to " *_WS-Addressing_policy_* ", WS-Addressing will be
enabled for the endpoint defined by the contract above.
