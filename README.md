 # JBossWS-CXF

 Building and running the testsuite
------------------------------------

Building and running the testsuite requires Maven version 3.2.2 or higher.

The build follows the usual Maven build, and all tests run against the default WildFly version.
```
mvn clean install
```

* The `-Dserver.home=/foo/bar` option can be used to run the testsuite against a given local server instance; the server must not be already running, as the build will create various standalone server configurations and start multiple instances.
* The `-Dexclude-udp-tests` option can be used to skip UDP tests; that might be needed when running on a network that does not allow UDP broadcast.
* The `-Dexclude-ws-discovery-tests` option can be used to skip WS-Discovery tests; that might be needed when running on a network that does not have set multicast properly.
* The `-Dnodeploy` option can be used to avoid upgrading the ws stack on the target server container.
* The `-Dnoprepare` option can be used to avoid integration tests preparation phase, which includes tuning of the server configurations, wsconsume/wsprovide invocations, etc.
* The `-Ddebug` option can be used to turn on surefire debugging of integration tests only.
* The `-Djboss.bind.address=x.y.w.z` option can be used to have the started containers bound to the specified network interface address.
* The `-Dipv6` option can be used to run the integration testsuite using IPv6 protocol.
* The `-Delytron` option can be used to run the integration testsuite against container with Elytron security configuration.
* The `-Darquillian.deploymentExportPath=target/foo` option can be used to have Arquillian write the actual test deployments to disk.
* The `-DnoLogRedirect` can be used to prevent Surefire from redirecting console logs to test output files.
* The `-DenableServerLoggingToConsole` can be used to enable logging of server messages to console too, otherwise these messages are only redirected to specific log files.
* The `-Dts.dist.dependency.skip` can be used to remove dependency to jbossws-cxf-dist module which makes it possible to run tests directly from testsuite module against arbitrary server given by `-Dserver.home`.

The `fast` profile can also be used to run tests concurrently; run following command in such case to trigger test servers' shutdown and save memory at the end of each testsuite module:
```
mvn -Pfast post-integration-test
```

 Updating WS stack
-------------------

In some cases it might be needed to build the ws stack and install it on a specified server instance without running the integration testsuite; this is achieved as follows:
```
mvn -Dserver.home=/foo/bar package
```
If a `server.home` property is not provided, the build creates a zip archive with a vanilla WildFly server patched with the current WS stack:

```
mvn package
```
the zip file path is modules/dist/target/jbossws-cxf-dist-${project.version}-test-server.zip


 Cleaning up
-------------

The project is cleaned up as follows:
```
mvn -Pdist,testsuite clean
```

 Releasing
-----------

Releases are performed using the Maven Release Plugin; no manual modification of artifact versions in pom.xml files is hence required. The release is tagged with the following command:
```
 mvn release:prepare
```

The release tag can then be checked out, built and deployed to the nexus repository.
To clean the release plugin data (in case of errors), run:
```
mvn -Pdist,testsuite release:clean
```
